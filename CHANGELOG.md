## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Upstream canary failures are reported as an issue (#521)** — `.github/workflows/upstream-canary.yml` keeps its canary jobs non-blocking (`continue-on-error`, schedule and manual dispatch only), so a failing run against `pycubrid@main` used to pass silently. A new `report` job runs after both canary jobs on scheduled and dispatched runs of the default branch (dispatches from feature branches never touch the shared issue, and cancelled runs are not reported): on failure it opens an issue titled "Upstream canary failing against pycubrid@main" with the `ci` label, or comments on the open one instead of creating a duplicate, listing each job's outcome, the run URL, the pycubrid commit tested and the sqlalchemy-cubrid ref and commit; once both jobs pass again it closes that issue with a comment. Each canary job now resolves `pycubrid@main` with `git ls-remote`, installs that exact commit and exposes it and its own status as job outputs, because job-level `continue-on-error` hides failures from `needs.<job>.result`. The workflow defaults to `contents: read`; only the report job has `issues: write`, and it uses the `gh` CLI with `GITHUB_TOKEN` (no third-party action), runs one at a time (`concurrency`), and has no `continue-on-error`, so a failure to report turns the run red. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` (+ Korean) describes the reporting.
- **Blocking SQLAlchemy compliance lanes for released pycubrid (#463)** — the official SQLAlchemy compliance suite now gates merges for `cubrid+pycubrid://` as well as CUBRIDdb, as steps of the existing `integration-tests` cells (no new job or CUBRID service): lane `pycubrid@sa2.1` (pycubrid 1.7.1, SQLAlchemy 2.1.1) on Python 3.14 × CUBRID 11.4 and lane `pycubrid@sa2.0` (pycubrid 1.7.1, SQLAlchemy 2.0.53) on Python 3.10 × CUBRID 10.2, both pinned and both recording versions via `scripts/report_driver_versions.py`; the CUBRIDdb lane (`cubrid@sa2.0`, CUBRID 11.4) is unchanged. `test/known_failures.txt` is now keyed per lane: every entry names the `<driver>@sa<major.minor>` lanes (optionally `@cubrid<major.minor>` for a server-specific failure) it fails in and is strict-xfailed only there, so a failure baselined for one driver cannot hide a regression on the other. With `CUBRID_STRICT_KNOWN_FAILURES=1` a strict XPASS, a stale entry, a listed entry that is skipped instead of xfailed, a lane with no reviewed baseline, or a SQLAlchemy release other than the lane's pinned one fails the run; a malformed entry, a duplicated node id or a server-narrowed tag outside the (lane, server) pairs CI gates is a load error. The pycubrid compliance step runs even when the CUBRIDdb lane failed. A new offline `test/test_known_failures.py` validates the manifest format. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) describe the lanes and the baseline update process.
- **Required driver-differential lane with an all-skipped guard and version record (#486)** — the regular and full integration jobs now run `test/test_driver_differential.py` with pycubrid and CUBRIDdb and `CUBRID_REQUIRE_DRIVER_DIFFERENTIAL=1`; with that variable set, `test/conftest.py` fails the session when no comparison ran and passed, so a lane where every case skipped or none was collected no longer reports success. Local runs without the variable still skip cleanly. `scripts/report_driver_versions.py` records the exact Python, SQLAlchemy, pycubrid, CUBRIDdb and CUBRID server versions in the job log and the GitHub step summary. New differential cases cover Core `executemany` with integer, UTF-8/CJK and NULL values, textual `executemany` with integer and UTF-8/CJK values (CUBRIDdb 11.3.0.51 reuses the previous row's value for a NULL parameter there), scalar binds, textual-SQL result column names, and commit/rollback visibility; contract areas blocked upstream are tracked in #480–#484 (#480 and #481 have since added differential cases). `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` now states that a specific pycubrid release candidate must pass the downstream contract suite before the `pycubrid>=1.3.2,<2.0` bound is widened, while the weekly `pycubrid@main` canary stays non-blocking. Tests and CI only; no dialect behavior change.
- **Live BLOB/CLOB value-contract tests on released drivers (#485)** — `test_integration.py` (CUBRIDdb and `cubrid+pycubrid://` lanes) and `test_aio_integration.py` (`cubrid+aiopycubrid://`) now round-trip `LargeBinary`, `BLOB`, `CLOB` and `Text` through Core and ORM with small, Unicode/CJK, `NULL` and 256 KiB payloads (larger than pycubrid's ~80 KB `LOB_READ` chunk), and assert the returned value is `bytes`/`str`, never a driver LOB handle. Verified on CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4: writes store the full value and `NULL`/`Text` round-trip, but non-NULL `BLOB`/`CLOB` reads return a driver LOB locator (pycubrid `dict` handle, CUBRIDdb `'file:...'` string), and async `LargeBinary`/`BLOB` binding fails because the async DB-API adapter lacks `Binary`. Those cases are strict per-driver xfails; `docs/TYPES.md`, `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` document the current behavior (reflection is unaffected), and the `CLOB` type row no longer lists `sqlalchemy.Text`, which compiles to `STRING`. No dialect behavior changes.
- **Live tests that results are never silently truncated across commit or rollback (#481)** — `test_integration.py` (CUBRIDdb and `cubrid+pycubrid://` lanes) and `test_aio_integration.py` read a 500-row, 1000-byte-per-row result (more than pycubrid's 100-row FETCH batch; the broker's first response holds ~16 rows) with `fetchone()`, `fetchmany()` and `fetchall()` after `commit()`, `rollback()` or no boundary, and require every row or a DB-API error, never a successful partial `Result`. The driver-differential suite adds the rollback case for both drivers. Verified on CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4: CUBRIDdb 11.3.0.51 returns all rows after commit and raises `InterfaceError` after rollback; pycubrid `main` raises `InterfaceError`; released pycubrid 1.7.1 silently returns only the buffered rows on a warm connection (cubrid-lab/pycubrid#395), so those sync cases are strict xfails for pycubrid only via `test/pycubrid_upstream.py` (no-op under `CUBRID_PYCUBRID_UPSTREAM=1`, set by the `pycubrid@main` integration canary; see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`). Async results pass on every driver because `AsyncConnection.execute()` buffers the whole result. `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` documents the per-driver behavior. Tests, CI and docs only; no dialect behavior change.
- **Live `IntegrityError` contract tests for constraint violations (#480)** — `test_integration.py` (CUBRIDdb and `cubrid+pycubrid://` lanes), `test_aio_integration.py` (`cubrid+aiopycubrid://`) and the driver-differential suite now check through Core and ORM that NOT NULL, foreign-key and unique/primary-key (control) violations raise `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError`, and that the same connection or `Session` runs new statements after `rollback()`. Verified on CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4: CUBRIDdb 11.3.0.51 and pycubrid `main` pass every case; released pycubrid 1.7.1 raises NOT NULL (-631) and foreign-key (-922) violations as `DatabaseError` (cubrid-lab/pycubrid#390), so those cases are strict xfails for the pycubrid drivers only. The new `test/pycubrid_upstream.py` helper applies such xfails unless `CUBRID_PYCUBRID_UPSTREAM=1`, which the weekly `pycubrid@main` integration canary sets; `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` documents it and when to remove it. `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` documents the per-driver exception classes. Tests, CI and docs only; no dialect behavior change.
- **Stronger `IntegrityError` contract tests (#480)** — the Core, ORM, async and driver-differential constraint-violation tests now prove same-connection reuse: the error does not invalidate the connection, and after `rollback()` the same `Connection` (and, for the ORM, a `Session` bound to it) keeps the same DBAPI connection. Before the pycubrid-only xfail is applied, they also assert the native server error code (-631 NOT NULL, -922 foreign key, -670 unique; pycubrid `Error.code`, CUBRIDdb `args[0]`), and the class assertion also checks that `exc.orig` is the driver's `IntegrityError`. A patched `is_disconnect()` that always returns `True` now fails these tests. The `is_disconnect()` docstring no longer claims CUBRIDdb lacks `OperationalError`. Tests and docs only; no behavior change.
- **Stronger result-completeness tests (#481)** — the sync test now asserts that CUBRIDdb raises `sqlalchemy.exc.InterfaceError` after rollback (and no error otherwise). It reads the FETCH batch size from pycubrid's `Connection` signature instead of hardcoding 100. Every fetched prefix must be in order with intact payloads before the pycubrid#395 xfail applies, and the marker now covers only the completeness assertion; an explicit error still turns into a strict XPASS on a fixed build. The driver-differential case also checks that pycubrid's first response does not hold the whole result. A new async case drives the lazily fetching `pycubrid.aio` cursor directly (execute, fetch one, commit or rollback, fetch the rest); released pycubrid 1.7.1 silently returns 16 of 500 rows there, so it is a strict xfail for pycubrid#395. `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` Known Issue 8 (en/ko) records the raw async cursor behavior. Tests and docs only; no behavior change.
- **Live `cursor.description` contract tests (#482)** — `test_integration.py` (CUBRIDdb and `cubrid+pycubrid://` lanes) and `test_aio_integration.py` (`cubrid+aiopycubrid://`) check the subset SQLAlchemy exposes: `Result.keys()` versus description names for `text()` aliases/expressions and Core `select()`, representative scalar type codes, `null_ok` for nullable and NOT NULL columns, `SET`/`MULTISET`/`SEQUENCE` type codes, reflected nullability, and sync/async pycubrid agreement; the driver-differential suite adds a scalar-description comparison. Verified on CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4: CUBRIDdb 11.3.0.51 and pycubrid `main` pass (CUBRIDdb reports collection columns with CCI composite codes such as 40 for `SET(INTEGER)`, recorded per driver); released pycubrid 1.7.1 reports `null_ok` inverted (cubrid-lab/pycubrid#431) and collection columns as their element type (cubrid-lab/pycubrid#430), so those cases are strict xfails for pycubrid only via `test/pycubrid_upstream.py` (no-op under `CUBRID_PYCUBRID_UPSTREAM=1`, set by the `pycubrid@main` integration canary; see `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`). `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md` documents that the dialect passes `cursor.description` through without normalization. Tests, CI and docs only; no dialect behavior change.
- **Review follow-ups for the #480/#481 contract tests** — the result-completeness checks (sync, raw async cursor and driver-differential) now validate the order and payload of every returned row, including the one consumed by `fetchone()`, before the pycubrid#395 xfail applies. The driver-differential constraint-violation case now also asserts that `exc.orig` is the driver's own `IntegrityError` for CUBRIDdb and, behind the existing pycubrid#390 marker, for pycubrid. Tests only; no behavior change.

### Changed
- **Alembic: CUBRID DDL is transactional, so the whole upgrade is now atomic by default (#503)** — `CubridImpl.transactional_ddl` is now `True` (was `False`). The docs and docstrings claimed CUBRID implicitly commits DDL; it does not. With client autocommit off, which the dialect always sets, `ROLLBACK` undoes `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `CREATE INDEX` (including `WITH ONLINE [PARALLEL n]`), `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE SERIAL` and `RENAME TABLE`, and DDL never commits pending DML; client autocommit is the only auto-commit behavior. **Behavior change:** a failed `alembic upgrade` now rolls back every revision of that run, including the `alembic_version` update, instead of keeping the revisions that finished before the failure (each revision was already atomic on its own, because Alembic's online mode wraps it in `connection.begin()`), and `context.is_transactional_ddl()` returns `True`. Set `transaction_per_migration=True` in `context.configure()` to keep per-revision commits; it is recommended for long or large-table migrations, because uncommitted DDL holds schema locks (other sessions wait on `SCH_S_LOCK`). `CubridImpl.emit_begin()` now emits nothing, because CUBRID has no `BEGIN` statement (csql rejects it), so offline `--sql` scripts contain no `BEGIN;` and end each transaction with `COMMIT;`; run them with `csql --no-auto-commit --no-single-line` (csql's default single-line mode continues past a failing statement, still runs the trailing `COMMIT;` and exits 0). New live tests in `test/test_transactional_ddl.py` (run in the PR and full integration matrices with `CUBRID_REQUIRE_TRANSACTIONAL_DDL=1`, which turns an unavailable driver, server or csql into a failure instead of a skip) prove, on CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4 with pycubrid and CUBRIDdb, that each of those statements rolls back, that DDL does not commit earlier DML and that `metadata.create_all()` rolls back; that a failing multi-revision Alembic upgrade leaves no partial schema and no version row, while `transaction_per_migration=True` keeps the completed revision; and that offline `--sql` output runs in csql. README (and translations), `docs/ALEMBIC.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/ISOLATION_LEVELS.md`, `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/ORM_COOKBOOK.md` (+ Korean), `docs/PRD.md`, AGENTS.md, `llms.txt` and `scripts/alembic_safety_check.py` no longer describe DDL as auto-committed or recommend one DDL operation per revision.

### Removed
- **Removed the dead SQLAlchemy 1.x `should_autocommit_text()` hook, its `AUTOCOMMIT_REGEXP`, and the legacy `dbapi()` classmethods (#462)** — SQLAlchemy 2.0 and 2.1 `DefaultExecutionContext` no longer define or call `should_autocommit_text()`, so the regex it consulted never affected a supported runtime (this also retires #439's request to add `REPLACE` to it, surfaced by @biggdawg320 in #468: there is no longer a regex to be inconsistent with the dialect's `REPLACE INTO` construct). `create_engine()` only falls back to a `dbapi()` classmethod when the dialect class does not define `import_dbapi()` itself, and `CubridDialect`, `PyCubridDialect` and `PyCubridAsyncDialect` all do, so the `dbapi()` wrappers were unreachable. Transactions are unchanged: DML and DDL text commits only via `conn.commit()`, `engine.begin()` or a `Session`. Added offline regression tests asserting the hooks stay gone, that engine creation resolves the DBAPI via `import_dbapi()` without a deprecation warning, and that `DELETE`/`REPLACE`/`CREATE` text is rolled back unless explicitly committed; `docs/CONNECTION.md`, `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md`, `docs/DML_EXTENSIONS.md`, `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) and `docs/PRD.md` no longer describe the non-existent statement-text autocommit detection.

### Fixed
- **Docker integration cleanup runs after failures (#446)** — `make integration` now registers shell-exit cleanup before starting Docker, so failed startup, readiness waiting and tests all attempt `docker compose down -v`. An original failure is preserved if cleanup also fails; cleanup-only failure is reported and returns a failing status. Offline subprocess regressions cover both test outcomes, cleanup failures, setup failures and the unchanged Docker-free `integration-local` target.\n- **Reflecting a missing table or view raises `NoSuchTableError` (#530)** — `get_foreign_keys()` and `get_unique_constraints()` returned `[]` for an object that does not exist (the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` fallbacks swallowed the server's `Unknown class` error with a WARNING traceback), `get_table_comment()` returned `{"text": None}`, and `get_pk_constraint()` and `get_view_definition()` let the raw -493 `ProgrammingError` escape. Because SQLAlchemy's default `get_multi_*()` implementations leave out only the names whose single-object method raises `NoSuchTableError`, the multi variants also reported the missing object. `get_foreign_keys()` and `get_unique_constraints()` now look up the class type first (the cached, owner-aware `db_class` lookup from #529): no row raises `NoSuchTableError`, and a view (`VCLASS`) returns `[]` without running the table-only `SHOW CREATE TABLE`, which removes the WARNING traceback logged for every reflected view. `get_table_comment()` raises when `db_class` has no row, and matches the name like the class-type lookup (as given or lower-cased, the current user's class first). `get_pk_constraint()` (`SHOW COLUMNS` fallback), `get_view_definition()` (`SHOW CREATE VIEW`) and the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` fallbacks of `get_foreign_keys()` / `get_unique_constraints()` map an error to `NoSuchTableError` only when its message is CUBRID's `Unknown class`: pycubrid reports syntax errors, `<name> is not a class` and some permission errors with the same -493 / SQLSTATE 42S02 (#454), so a generic -493 still propagates (or, in the DDL fallbacks, keeps the logged empty result). `get_view_definition()` on a table (for which `SHOW CREATE VIEW` returns no row) now raises `NoSuchTableError` instead of returning `""`, as SQLAlchemy's suite expects. The 9 entries of the #530 group, including `test_get_multi_unique_constraints[True-ObjectKind.ANY-ObjectScope.ANY…]` that also needed #529, are removed from `test/known_failures.txt` for all three lanes; `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md` (+ Korean) documents the behavior, and the per-lane counts in the `test/known_failures.txt` header and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) are updated (cubrid@sa2.0 68 / 61, pycubrid@sa2.0 54, pycubrid@sa2.1 58 / 51).
- **`UnicodeText` creates a CUBRID `STRING` column instead of the non-existent `TEXT` (#534)** — `CubridTypeCompiler` overrode `visit_text` (`Text` → `STRING`) but not `visit_unicode_text` or `visit_TEXT`, so `UnicodeText` and `sqlalchemy.TEXT` fell through to SQLAlchemy's generic `TEXT`, and `CREATE TABLE` failed with "dba.TEXT is not defined" (-494) on every CUBRID version. Both now compile to `STRING`, like `Text`; CUBRID strings use the database charset, so there is no separate national text type. Alembic's `compare_type` now also treats `UnicodeText` like `Text` against a reflected `VARCHAR(1073741823)`, so autogenerate does not report a spurious type change for it. New compiler tests and a live `CREATE TABLE` + Korean/Japanese/Chinese/emoji round trip on CUBRIDdb and pycubrid cover it, and the six `UnicodeTextTest` compliance entries are removed from `test/known_failures.txt` for every lane. `docs/TYPES.md` (+ Korean) and `docs/PRD.md` now list `UnicodeText` as `STRING`, and `Unicode(n)` as the `VARCHAR(n)` it actually compiles to; `docs/TYPES.md` (+ Korean) also notes that no column-level `CHARSET`/`COLLATE` is rendered for string and text types (`collation=` is dropped) and that non-ASCII text needs a UTF-8 database. The per-lane known-failure counts in the `test/known_failures.txt` header and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) are updated (cubrid@sa2.0 77 / 70, pycubrid@sa2.0 63, pycubrid@sa2.1 67 / 60).
- **Unique constraints are no longer reported twice, and views no longer reflect their base table's indexes (#529)** — CUBRID implements a `UNIQUE` constraint as a unique index and cannot tell it apart from `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` (same `_db_index` flags; `SHOW CREATE TABLE` prints both as `UNIQUE KEY`), so `get_indexes()` and `get_unique_constraints()` both listed the same object, and `Table` reflection built both a unique `Index` and a `UniqueConstraint` for it. Following SQLAlchemy's MySQL dialect, every `get_unique_constraints()` entry (catalog and `SHOW CREATE TABLE` paths) now carries `"duplicates_index": <name>`, so `Table` reflection and Alembic autogenerate keep only the unique index, and `requirements.py` opens `unique_constraints_reflect_as_index` and `unique_index_reflect_as_unique_constraints`. `get_indexes()` on a view returned the base table's indexes, including its primary key, because `SHOW INDEXES IN <view>` lists them; it now checks `db_class.class_type` and returns `[]` for a view (`VCLASS`). That lookup matches the name as given or folded to lower case, prefers the current user's class over a same-named class of another owner (CUBRID 11.2+ allows one per owner; a DBA view `y_dup` granted to PUBLIC made user u2's `get_indexes("y_dup")` return `[]`), and is cached per `Inspector`. Reflection also no longer leaks server query entries (#548): the single-row lookups (`db_class` class type and table comment, `SHOW CREATE TABLE` for foreign keys and the unique-constraint fallback, `SHOW CREATE VIEW`) read their row with `Result.first()`, which closes the result, instead of `fetchone()`, which left it open. Each open result held one of the connection's 100 server query entries, so `MetaData.reflect()` of about 50–60 tables on one pycubrid connection failed with -830 "Cannot allocate query entry". An audit found no other unclosed single-row read in `dialect.py`, `base.py`, `pycubrid_dialect.py`, `alembic_impl.py` or `trace.py` (the raw-cursor `fetchone()` calls close their cursor in `finally`). New live tests reflect 150 tables on one connection (pycubrid on CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4, and CUBRIDdb) and reflect a u2 table that shares its name with a DBA view (CUBRID 11.2+). The 36 `ComponentReflectionTest` entries of the #529 group are removed from `test/known_failures.txt` for all three lanes; `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md` (+ Korean) documents the behavior, and the per-lane counts in the `test/known_failures.txt` header and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) are updated (cubrid@sa2.0 83 / 76, pycubrid@sa2.0 69, pycubrid@sa2.1 73 / 66).
- **`get_foreign_keys()` returns foreign keys sorted by name (#531)** — the constraints were returned in the order `SHOW CREATE TABLE` lists them, which is not name order, so the SQLAlchemy compliance suite's `ComponentReflectionTest::test_get_multi_foreign_keys` (which expects `fk_dingalings_id_user` before `zz_email_add_id_fg`) compared the wrong foreign keys even though each reflected constraint was correct. `get_foreign_keys()` (and therefore `get_multi_foreign_keys()`) now sorts by constraint name, like SQLAlchemy's built-in dialects. The 8 `test_get_multi_foreign_keys[False-…]` entries are removed from `test/known_failures.txt` for all three lanes; the per-lane counts in its header and in `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) are updated (cubrid@sa2.0 119 / 112, pycubrid@sa2.0 105, pycubrid@sa2.1 109 / 102).
- **Foreign keys and unique constraints on column names containing parentheses are reflected (#532)** — the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` parser matched a constraint's column list up to the first `)`, so a bracketed name such as `[(3)]` cut the list short: `REFERENCES [dba.p] ([(3)])` reflected `referred_columns: []`, and autoloading the child table raised `ArgumentError`. `_RE_FOREIGN_KEY` and `_RE_UNIQUE_KEY` now match the column list as a sequence of bracketed names (each optionally followed by `ASC`/`DESC`, with optional whitespace inside the parentheses), so names containing `(`, `)`, `,` or spaces parse correctly. New offline regex tests use DDL captured from CUBRID 11.4 for such names. The 6 `BizarroCharacterTest::test_fk_ref[…-(3)-…]` entries are removed from `test/known_failures.txt` for all three lanes; the per-lane counts in its header and in `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) are updated (cubrid@sa2.0 127 / 120, pycubrid@sa2.0 113, pycubrid@sa2.1 117 / 110).
- **`Index.drop()` and Alembic `op.drop_index()` emit `DROP INDEX <name> ON <table>` (#533)** — `CubridDDLCompiler` had no `visit_drop_index`, so SQLAlchemy's generic `DROP INDEX <name>` was emitted and CUBRID rejected it with a -493 syntax error (CUBRID scopes an index to its table). The compiler now emits `DROP INDEX <quoted name> ON <quoted table>`, including the table's schema when one is set. CUBRID 10.2, 11.0, 11.2 and 11.4 have no `DROP INDEX IF EXISTS` (all four answer a syntax error), so `DropIndex(..., if_exists=True)` and `op.drop_index(..., if_exists=True)` now raise `CompileError` instead of emitting SQL the server rejects; check `inspect(conn).has_index()` first, as `Index.drop(checkfirst=True)` does. An index not bound to a table also raises `CompileError`, and `op.drop_index()` without `table_name` (which Alembic binds to a placeholder table named `no_table`) raises `CompileError` asking for `table_name` instead of emitting `DROP INDEX <name> ON no_table`. `CubridDialect.has_index()` is now `@reflection.cache`d like `has_table()` and the `get_*` methods, so an `Inspector` answers `has_index()` from its cache until `clear_cache()` (calls without an `info_cache`, such as `Index.drop(checkfirst=True)`, still query the catalog each time); with the drop fixed this was the remaining `HasIndexTest::test_has_index[inspector]` failure. Because a cached answer lives as long as the `Inspector`, a failing catalog query in `has_index()` now raises instead of being swallowed as `False`; a missing table or index still returns `False`. The per-lane known-failure counts in the `test/known_failures.txt` header and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) are updated (cubrid@sa2.0 133 / 126, pycubrid@sa2.0 119, pycubrid@sa2.1 123 / 116). New compiler tests, an offline cache test, offline Alembic `--sql` tests and live `Index.drop()` / `op.drop_index()` tests cover it, and the `HasIndexTest::test_has_index[dialect|inspector]` compliance entries are removed from `test/known_failures.txt` for every lane. `docs/ALEMBIC.md` (+ Korean) documents the `ON <table>` form and the `if_exists` limitation.
- **JSON `.as_numeric(p, s)` returns `Decimal` instead of `float` (#535)** — a JSON element cast with `as_numeric()` was rendered `CAST(JSON_EXTRACT(...) AS DOUBLE)`, so the driver returned a `float`, and because the dialect declares native decimal support no result processor converted it: `select(t.c.data["a"].as_numeric(10, 2))` returned `15.0` instead of `Decimal('15.00')` and lost precision, on SQLAlchemy 2.0 and 2.1 alike. A `Numeric` target with both precision and scale now renders `CAST(JSON_EXTRACT(...) AS NUMERIC(p,s))`, as SQLAlchemy's MySQL dialect renders `DECIMAL(p, s)`, and both drivers return a `Decimal` at scale `s` (JSON numbers, including exponent notation such as `1e3`, plain-decimal numeric strings such as `"15.5"`, and `true`/`false` cast; JSON `null` is still SQL `NULL`). CUBRID raises -181 ("Cannot coerce value of domain json to domain numeric") for a string in exponent notation (`"1e3"`) and for a non-numeric string such as `"abc"` or `""`, and -427 (data overflow) for a value that does not fit `NUMERIC(p,s)`. For exponent-notation strings and values outside `NUMERIC(p,s)`, use `as_float()`, which casts to `DOUBLE`. `as_float()` also raises -181 for a non-numeric string, so validate or filter such values before casting; with `asdecimal=False` the result is still converted to `float`. `as_float()` and any `Float` stay `DOUBLE`, and a `Numeric` without both precision and scale also stays `DOUBLE`, because a bare CUBRID `NUMERIC` means `NUMERIC(15,0)` and would truncate. Verified on CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4. New offline compiler tests and a live round trip in `test_integration.py` (CUBRIDdb and pycubrid, SQLAlchemy 2.0.53 and 2.1.1) cover it; the 18 `JSONTest::test_index_cross_casts[...-numeric]` entries are removed from `test/known_failures.txt` (lane `pycubrid@sa2.1`: 143 / 136 → 125 / 118), and `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md` (+ Korean) lists `as_numeric()`.
- **`isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT"` works on every driver, and an engine-level isolation level survives a per-connection override (#501)** — `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` recommended `execution_options(isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT")`, but `get_isolation_level_values()` did not list it, so `execution_options()` raised `ArgumentError` and `create_engine(..., isolation_level="AUTOCOMMIT")` raised `ValueError` on first connect, on `cubrid://`, `cubrid+pycubrid://` and `cubrid+aiopycubrid://`. `CubridDialect` kept `isolation_level` to itself and applied it from its own `on_connect` hooks, bypassing SQLAlchemy's validation, and its `reset_isolation_level()` override always reset a checked-in connection to READ COMMITTED, dropping an engine-level level after a per-connection override. Following SQLAlchemy's mysqldb/psycopg pattern, `AUTOCOMMIT` is now a valid level: `set_isolation_level()` turns on the driver's `autocommit` (CUBRIDdb, pycubrid and the async adapter all expose the property), and any other level turns it off before `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL`. It toggles only when the mode changes, because on pycubrid each toggle ends the transaction and triggers a reconnect. `detect_autocommit_setting()` reads the same flag, so `create_engine(skip_autocommit_rollback=True)` works too. `isolation_level` is passed to `DefaultDialect`, which applies it on connect after the dialect disables autocommit and restores it on checkin; the `reset_isolation_level()` override and the `on_connect` isolation handling are removed. An engine-level alias is stored under its canonical name (for example `CURSOR STABILITY` becomes `READ COMMITTED`), so SQLAlchemy's checkin restore accepts it. Invalid levels now raise `ArgumentError` from `create_engine()`, `engine.execution_options()` and `conn.execution_options()` on every driver, and a non-string `isolation_level` raises it from the dialect constructor; calling `dialect.set_isolation_level()` directly still raises `ValueError`, and a DBAPI connection without an `autocommit` property now fails with `AttributeError` instead of being treated as non-autocommit. Behavior changes for code outside `create_engine()`: `on_connect()` no longer applies `isolation_level`, so a pool built by hand around `dialect.on_connect()` must apply it itself (or use `dialect._builtin_onconnect()` like `create_engine()`); and `dialect.isolation_level` now holds the canonical name (`CURSOR STABILITY` reads back as `READ COMMITTED`). On pycubrid, `AUTOCOMMIT` statements run at the server default level and reconnect the broker session each time (cubrid-lab/pycubrid#468); the docs recommend `skip_autocommit_rollback=True` with an engine-level `AUTOCOMMIT` there. New live tests on all three drivers cover each path: an AUTOCOMMIT row is visible to a second session before any commit and survives `rollback()`, the same pooled connection is transactional after checkin, the engine-level level (SERIALIZABLE or AUTOCOMMIT, sync and async) and an engine-level alias are restored on the same pooled connection after a per-connection override, `skip_autocommit_rollback=True` works with engine-level AUTOCOMMIT, and invalid levels raise `ArgumentError`. They fail without the fix. `docs/ISOLATION_LEVELS.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md` (+ Korean) document `AUTOCOMMIT` and the checkin restore.
- **Engine- and connection-level `isolation_level` no longer falls back to READ COMMITTED on pycubrid after `commit()` / `rollback()` (#505)** — after the driver's `commit()` or `rollback()` the broker returns the CAS status byte as inactive (out of transaction), and pycubrid 1.7.1 (and `main`) then opens a new broker connection before the next request. The new session starts at the server default level, and pycubrid restores only `autocommit`, so `create_engine("cubrid+pycubrid://…", isolation_level="SERIALIZABLE")` already reported READ COMMITTED on the first checkout (SQLAlchemy rolls back after its first-connect checks), and a per-connection level was lost at the next commit. `CUBRIDdb` keeps the same session and was not affected; the driver bug is cubrid-lab/pycubrid#468. `PyCubridDialect` (and the async dialect) now remember the level they set on each DBAPI connection and re-apply it in `do_commit()` / `do_rollback()`. This costs one `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` + `COMMIT` per commit/rollback, only on connections with a configured level; nothing runs per statement, and such a pooled connection holds a broker CAS while idle. A failed re-apply never turns a successful commit into an error or masks the exception that caused a rollback: it is logged and retried in `do_begin()` before the next transaction's first statement. On an engine without a configured level, checkin after a per-connection override stops the re-apply for that connection. Remove the workaround once a pycubrid release fixing pycubrid#468 is the minimum. New live tests on all three drivers check `get_isolation_level()` after commit, rollback, pool checkin (including the pool's reset-on-return rollback alone), `engine.begin()` and a `Session`, and fail without the fix on pycubrid; pycubrid-only live tests simulate a failed re-apply and check that the commit stands, the rollback's `IntegrityError` propagates and the next transaction runs at the configured level. `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` Known Issue 10 and `docs/ISOLATION_LEVELS.md` (+ Korean) document the driver behavior and the re-apply. Resetting to the engine level after a per-connection override is tracked in #501.
- **`driver_connection` on `cubrid+aiopycubrid://` is now the `pycubrid.aio` connection (#520)** — `PyCubridAsyncDialect` did not override `get_driver_connection()`, so `(await conn.get_raw_connection()).driver_connection` returned SQLAlchemy's `AsyncAdapt_pycubrid_connection` adapter instead of the driver's own connection. The dialect now returns the wrapped `pycubrid.aio.AsyncConnection`, as SQLAlchemy's asyncpg and aiomysql dialects do, so driver-specific async APIs (`ping()`, `cursor()`, ...) are reachable through the documented accessor. A unit test and a live async test cover it, and the async integration tests no longer reach the driver connection through `.dbapi_connection.driver_connection` or the adapter's `_connection`. Code that relied on `driver_connection` being the adapter should use `dbapi_connection` instead.
- **The SQLAlchemy compliance suite no longer silently skips most of its tests (#463)** — every property in `sqlalchemy_cubrid/requirements.py` returned one shared `exclusions.open()` / `exclusions.closed()` object, and SQLAlchemy extends the first requirement of a stacked `@testing.requires` chain in place, so after collection every "open" requirement also carried the closed rule's skip. Each property now returns a new object (a regression test checks that stacking does not leak). About 300 more suite tests now run per lane (pycubrid, SQLAlchemy 2.0.53, CUBRID 11.4: 334 → 631 passed), and the baselines of all three lanes were recaptured on fresh CUBRID 10.2 and 11.4 databases and classified. The recapture also opens `reflects_pk_names` and `implicitly_named_constraints` (the suite reported unexpected successes), gates `unicode_ddl` on a UTF-8 database (the official Docker image creates ISO-8859-1 databases, where non-ASCII table names break both drivers' catalog decoding for every later test), and closes `precision_generic_float_type` (CUBRID `FLOAT` is single precision). Newly visible dialect bugs are listed as strict known failures, each linked to its follow-up issue: unique constraints reported twice and views reflecting their base table's indexes (#529), missing-object reflection not raising `NoSuchTableError` (#530), foreign keys returned in DDL order instead of sorted by name (#531), bracketed column names containing parentheses such as `[(3)]` not parsed in FK/UNIQUE DDL (#532), `Index.drop()` emitting `DROP INDEX` without `ON <table>` (#533), `UnicodeText` compiling to `TEXT` (#534), and JSON `.as_numeric()` returning `float` instead of `Decimal` (#535).
- **`Inspector.has_table()` honors the inspector cache (#463)** — `CubridDialect.has_table()` was not decorated with `@reflection.cache`, so `inspect(engine).has_table()` queried the catalog on every call and reported a table created after the first call before `clear_cache()`, unlike SQLAlchemy's built-in dialects. Found by the SQLAlchemy 2.1 `HasTableTest::test_has_table_cache` in the new pycubrid compliance lane (SQLAlchemy 2.0's harness never reached it). Direct `dialect.has_table()` calls without an `info_cache` and `create_all(checkfirst=True)` are unaffected.
- **`cubrid://` executemany no longer stores the previous row's value for `None` or reports a last-row rowcount (#502)** — CUBRIDdb 11.3.0.51 skips binding `None` and prepares `executemany` once, so a `None` parameter kept the previous row's value, and its `rowcount` counted only the last row. Through SQLAlchemy this silently corrupted `text()` and Core `UPDATE`/`DELETE` executemany and made batched ORM UPDATEs raise `StaleDataError`. `CubridDialect.do_executemany` now executes each parameter set and reports the summed rowcount, so `supports_sane_multi_rowcount` is accurate on both drivers. `cubrid+pycubrid://` and `cubrid+aiopycubrid://` keep the driver's prepare-once `executemany`, and a multi-row Core `insert()` that uses insertmanyvalues is unaffected. An INSERT into a table with a column whose type defines `bind_expression()` falls back to executemany (#421), so on `cubrid://` it uses the per-row guard. The textual executemany differential case now includes NULL, the CUBRIDdb `RowCountTest` multi-row entries are removed from `test/known_failures.txt`, `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` (+ Korean) records the driver bug and when the guard will be removed, and `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (+ Korean) documents executemany rowcount behavior and the guard's per-row cost.
- **Alembic finds `CubridImpl` with a default `env.py` (#504)** — `alembic upgrade` against a `cubrid://`, `cubrid+pycubrid://` or `cubrid+aiopycubrid://` URL failed with `KeyError: 'cubrid'` unless `env.py` imported `sqlalchemy_cubrid.alembic_impl` by hand. The package declared an `alembic.ddl` entry point, but no Alembic release reads that group: Alembic looks the impl up in a registry keyed by `dialect.name` that `DefaultImpl` subclasses fill on import, and the `alembic.plugins` entry points it does read exist only from 1.18 onward. `sqlalchemy_cubrid/dialect.py` now imports `alembic_impl` when Alembic is installed and skips it when it is not, which is how other third-party dialects register their impl and works on every supported Alembic release; all dialect variants share `name = "cubrid"`. The dead `alembic.ddl` entry point is removed. The standard `alembic init` template works unchanged for the synchronous URLs; for `cubrid+aiopycubrid://` online migrations, `docs/ALEMBIC.md` now points to Alembic's async template (`alembic init -t async`), whose unmodified `env.py` was verified live on CUBRID 11.4 (the standard template's synchronous engine fails there with `MissingGreenlet`). The import never stops the dialect from loading: a missing Alembic is skipped silently, and an installed Alembic that fails to import (1.7.0/1.7.1 raise `NameError` on SQLAlchemy 2.x) only disables the integration with one `RuntimeWarning` naming the exception (logged via the `sqlalchemy_cubrid.dialect` logger instead if a warning filter turns it into an error). The `[alembic]`/`[dev]` extras, the pre-commit mypy hook and the docs now require `alembic>=1.7.2,<2.0`, the oldest release that imports on SQLAlchemy 2.x. A new `test/test_alembic_registration.py` runs the `alembic` CLI in a fresh interpreter on an unmodified `alembic init` project, offline (`--sql`) for all four URL forms and online against a live CUBRID; it fails on the previous code with the reported `KeyError`. The roundtrip tests no longer import `alembic_impl` themselves. README (and translations), `docs/ALEMBIC.md`, `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (+ Korean), `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md`, AGENTS.md and the wheel smoke checks now describe and verify registration on dialect import.
- **Async `LargeBinary` / `BLOB` binding no longer raises `AttributeError` (#500)** — `AsyncAdapt_pycubrid_dbapi` copied only `paramstyle`, the exception classes and the type objects from `pycubrid`, but SQLAlchemy's `LargeBinary` bind processor reads `dialect.dbapi.Binary` whenever the statement compiles, so every `cubrid+aiopycubrid://` INSERT/UPDATE touching a binary column failed, even with `None` or an unset ORM attribute. The adapter now copies the full PEP 249 module surface (`apilevel`, `threadsafety`, `paramstyle`, all exception classes, `Date`/`Time`/`Timestamp`, the `*FromTicks` constructors, `Binary` and the `STRING`/`BINARY`/`NUMBER`/`DATETIME`/`ROWID` type objects) from the sync module via one declared tuple. A unit test asserts every PEP 249 name on `pycubrid` is on the adapter; live async tests cover Core inserts of `None` and `bytes` into `LargeBinary`/`BLOB` and an ORM insert with an unset `LargeBinary`. The async binding xfails from #485 are removed, leaving only the strict LOB-read locator xfails (cubrid-lab/pycubrid#441); `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` and `docs/TYPES.md` (+ Korean) no longer list the async `Binary` issue.
- **`String(0)` / `VARCHAR(0)` / `NVARCHAR(0)` no longer silently compile to the 4096 default (#440)** — the type compiler checked the length by truthiness, so an explicit `length=0` was treated as "no length" and rendered `VARCHAR(4096)` (or `NCHAR VARYING(4096)`). `length=None` still gets the documented default; an explicit zero now raises `CompileError`, since `VARCHAR(0)` is not a valid CUBRID length.
- **Reflection now returns table and view names in deterministic order (#443)** — added `ORDER BY class_name` to `get_table_names()` and `get_view_names()` catalog queries so reflection results no longer depend on database row order.
- **Contributor workflow and docs exceptions clarified** — normal contributions use shared checks and matching docs; maintainers coordinate project-specific reviews, labels, translation deferrals and releases. Docs-not-needed body reasons require a populated standalone statement, with quoted/template examples excluded; executable doctests and real event/workflow regressions run locally and in docs-sync. Four existing reusable workflow callers are pinned to a verified upstream commit without changing their inputs or rollout settings.
- **Pure-driver integration setup is explicit (#464)** — `tox -e integration` now requires a `cubrid+pycubrid://` test URL rather than the former bare `cubrid://` C-extension URL. A bounded sync/async `SELECT 1` preflight fails before pytest when the URL, driver or database is unavailable. Async and stress suites derive their endpoint from the selected URL, preserving authentication, port and query options; an explicit `CUBRID_TEST_AURL` remains supported. The formal C-extension compliance CI route is unchanged, and optional native-driver comparisons remain explicitly skipped when that driver is absent.
- **Local tooling agrees with CI (#464)** — Ruff/mypy pre-commit revisions match the dev pins; the isolated mypy hook uses interpreter-compatible SQLAlchemy pins and existing Alembic dependencies without automatic stub installation. Tox covers Python 3.10–3.14, uses integration markers, retains 95% coverage, and matches CI's type-check cells. CLI/CI/tox share the Makefile's maintained Python source paths while hooks keep all tracked Python/pyi coverage. A deterministic consistency check rejects stale pins, missing interpreter branches, source omissions and runner drift. Two helper scripts received formatting-only changes with unchanged ASTs.
- **Strict typing is enforced across SQLAlchemy 2.0 and 2.1 (#459)** — timezone constructor annotations retain their always-enabled timezone behavior; compiler overrides match upstream positional arguments with typed boundaries for unannotated framework hooks. UNIQUE-index FK collision checks now raise a clear `CompileError` when no live Alembic connection is available. `make typecheck` reports dependency versions, and two pinned CI cells must pass through the required `matrix-result` check. Runtime SQL compilation and the 95% offline coverage threshold remain unchanged.
- **Async installation includes SQLAlchemy's required bridge (#448)** — the existing `[pycubrid]` and `[dev]` extras now request `SQLAlchemy[asyncio]`, which installs `greenlet` on both SQLAlchemy 2.0 and 2.1. The `[pycubrid]` extra intentionally supports sync and async URLs; bare installation keeps the same dependency contract. Fresh wheel smokes exercise async engine creation on 2.0.53 and 2.1.1 without a database or ambient packages. This is a patch-level installation bug fix.
- **Installation guidance distinguishes the driver from the async bridge (#448)** — FAQs, connection and troubleshooting guides, and translations now consistently state that pycubrid itself needs no CUBRID native libraries, while the `[pycubrid]` extra's `greenlet` dependency may need build tools when no compatible wheel is available.
- **Last-insert-ID SQL fallback works on SQLAlchemy 2.x (#458)** — both execution contexts now obtain a regular cursor from the active DBAPI connection for `SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()`, instead of calling SQLAlchemy's unimplemented server-side-cursor hook. Native driver IDs (including `None`) remain preferred, and the temporary cursor is closed even if execution, fetching, or integer conversion fails. This is a backward-compatible bug fix suitable for a patch release.
- **Nightly mutation testing migrated to mutmut 3** — the `dev` extra now pins `mutmut>=3.8,<4` (was `>=2.5,<3`; supersedes #450). The nightly `mutation-testing` job used mutmut 2 CLI options (`run --paths-to-mutate`, `result-ids`) that mutmut 3 removed, and masked failures with `|| true`, so an upgrade would have printed a wrong score instead of failing. The `[mutmut]` section in `setup.cfg` now uses mutmut 3 keys (`source_paths`, `only_mutate`, pytest arguments, `forkserver` process isolation because two MERGE tests cannot run twice in one process), and the job reads the score from `mutmut export-cicd-stats`. A mutmut crash, failing clean test run, zero mutants or zero kills now fails the step; surviving mutants only lower the reported score, and the job remains non-gating (`continue-on-error`). mutmut 3 generates more mutants than mutmut 2, so scores are not comparable with the earlier 288/449 baseline. CI/dev tooling only; no runtime change.

### Docs
- Added a README "First contribution" guide (with Korean translation) pointing newcomers to the right sibling repo for their first PR, and documented the `good first issue` → `status: in progress` label lifecycle in AGENTS.md.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- **Runnable usage examples in public docstrings (#337)** — added short, live-verified examples to the five main entry points: the connection URL forms (`cubrid+pycubrid://`, `cubrid+cubriddb://`, async `cubrid+aiopycubrid://`) in the package docstring, the `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` construct on `insert()`, and reflection via `inspect()` in the dialect module docstring (`REPLACE` and `MERGE` already had examples). Docstrings only — no behavior change; each example was executed against a live CUBRID 11.4.
- **UUID type contract test matrix (#376)** — added `test/test_uuid_contract.py`, which pins the full round-trip contract for `sa.Uuid()` (Python `uuid.UUID` values) and `sa.Uuid(as_uuid=False)` (string values) across INSERT, SELECT, WHERE, UPDATE, and reflection, against a live CUBRID. CUBRID has no native UUID type; the dialect stores it as `CHAR(32)`, and these 8 `integration`-marked tests catch any regression in that CHAR-backed storage or the value coercion (verified: `sa.Uuid()` round-trips as `uuid.UUID`, `as_uuid=False` as `str`, WHERE/UPDATE by UUID work, and reflection reports `CHAR`). Wired into the nightly `integration-full` bug-hunt job.
- **Mutation testing for `compiler.py` (stabilization Phase 8)** — added a `[mutmut]` configuration in `setup.cfg` (pinned `mutmut>=2.5,<3` in the `dev` extra) and a non-gating nightly `mutation-testing` job in `integration-full`. Mutation testing checks whether the offline suite actually *verifies* compiler logic rather than merely executing it: it mutates `compiler.py` and asserts the tests catch each change. The initial run scored 55.9% (251/449 mutants killed) and surfaced weak substring assertions — several tests asserted only `"JSON_EXTRACT" in sql`, `"LIMIT" in sql`, or `"GROUP_CONCAT" in sql` while letting the surrounding SQL structure mutate freely. Strengthening those to exact-match assertions on the full compiled output (JSON path extraction by type, `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` operand order and the offset-without-limit sentinel form, `UPDATE ... LIMIT`, and `GROUP_CONCAT`) raised the score to 64.1% (288/449). The job is `continue-on-error` because a score dip is a signal to strengthen a test, not a reason to block a release; the run needs no database.
- **Real-application ORM dogfood corpus (stabilization Phase 9)** — added `test/test_dogfood_orm.py`, which models a realistic schema (users 1:N orders, orders N:M tags) and drives it the way an application would, asserting on returned data rather than generated SQL. Covers relationship loading strategies (lazy, `selectinload` eager, `joinedload` eager, many-to-many, `back_populates` navigation), complex queries (join+filter, `GROUP BY`/`HAVING`, aggregate scalars, correlated subquery, `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` pagination, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`), and transactions/mutations (rollback discards changes, commit persists across sessions, bulk `UPDATE`, cascade delete of orphaned orders, auto-increment PK populated after `flush()`). These combinations surface dialect bugs the single-construct unit tests miss. All 16 tests are `integration`-marked and run in the nightly `integration-full` bug-hunt job across every supported CUBRID version.
- **CUBRID version-differential snapshot testing (stabilization Phase 6)** — added `test/version_differential/snapshot.py` and `test/version_differential/compare_snapshots.py`. The snapshot generator connects to one live CUBRID server and records a deterministic JSON of dialect-visible behavior: server capability probes (native ENUM, native BOOLEAN cast, `<=>`, CTE, window functions, `RETURNING`, `INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`) and the dialect's own `get_columns()` reflection of a fixed battery of column types. The nightly `integration-full` matrix now generates one snapshot per supported CUBRID version (10.2/11.0/11.2/11.4) and a new `version-differential` job compares them, failing if any dialect-visible behavior diverges across versions without being declared in `KNOWN_DIFFERENCES`. This enforces the support claim that a program sees identical dialect behavior on every supported CUBRID version, and turns any undeclared portability difference into a red nightly build.
- **Capability probe suite and driver-differential testing (stabilization Phases 5 & 7)** — added `test/capability/test_capability_probes.py`, which runs raw SQL against a live CUBRID and asserts the server's actual behavior matches what the dialect declares (`supports_native_enum`, `supports_native_boolean`, `supports_is_distinct_from`, `supports_multivalues_insert`, `supports_alter`, `supports_comments`, `insert_returning`, plus CTE/window/LIMIT-OFFSET), so a drift between a `supports_*` flag and reality is caught immediately instead of surfacing as a confusing downstream error. Added `test/test_driver_differential.py`, which runs the same Core operations on both the pycubrid and CUBRIDdb C-extension drivers and asserts they agree on SELECT round-trips, UPDATE/DELETE rowcount, aggregates, and NULL handling (skipping cleanly if the C-extension driver is not built). Both are `integration`-marked and run in the nightly `integration-full` bug-hunt job.
- **Property-based fuzz + metamorphic testing with Hypothesis (stabilization Phases 1–4)** — added `test/test_fuzz_select.py`, `test/test_fuzz_insert.py`, `test/test_fuzz_reflection.py`, and `test/test_metamorphic.py`. The fuzzers generate SELECT/INSERT combinations and random tables the hand-written suite never enumerated (boundary values `0`, `±1`, `2^31`, `2^63-1`, empty/Unicode/reserved-word/backslash strings) and assert dialect invariants: compilation raises only `CompileError` (never an unexpected exception), the positional-placeholder count equals the bound-parameter count, single/executemany/multi-values inserts store identical data, DDL→reflection round-trips agree (columns, nullability, primary keys, unique constraints), and (metamorphic) Core vs ORM SELECT, bind vs literal, and SQL LIMIT/OFFSET vs a Python slice return identical rows. Hypothesis profiles (`dev`/`ci`/`nightly`) are registered in `conftest.py`; PR CI runs the fast profile, and the nightly `integration-full` workflow runs the 2000-examples profile against live CUBRID. This bug-hunt found and fixed #426.

### Fixed
- **Removed the dead `implicit_returning = False` dialect attribute (#396)** — this was a SQLAlchemy 1.x-era switch with a comment claiming it prevents a `ResourceClosedError` on server-default INSERTs. In SQLAlchemy 2.x the CRUD compiler decides implicit `INSERT ... RETURNING` from `insert_returning` (already `False`), not `implicit_returning`, and `DefaultDialect` no longer even defines the attribute. Verified live on CUBRID 11.4 that a server-default INSERT + ORM refresh behaves identically with the attribute removed (no `ResourceClosedError`), and added an offline regression test asserting `insert_returning`/`update_returning`/`delete_returning` are the real switches and that the dead attribute stays gone.
- **`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` LIMIT/OFFSET section no longer documents SQL the dialect never emits (#416)** — the section claimed the dialect generates `LIMIT n OFFSET m` and that CUBRID rejects the comma form; both were wrong. The dialect **only ever** emits CUBRID's comma form `LIMIT offset, count` (offset first), and offset-without-limit uses a sentinel count. `select(users).limit(10).offset(20)` compiles to `LIMIT 20, 10`, not `LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20` — a reader trusting the old doc would also read the two operands in the wrong order. Corrected in both the English and Korean (`docs/ko/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`) docs.
- **`docs/llms-full.txt` regenerated and a drift-check added to CI (#383)** — the AI-facing doc bundle was stale relative to the corrected source docs (it still taught the pre-#356 `VALUES()` ODKU pattern). It is regenerated from source via `scripts/generate_llms_full.py`, and the `lint` CI job now fails if `llms-full.txt` drifts from its generating source (regenerate-and-diff), so it can no longer silently go stale.
- **Reflection gaps fixed: column comments, missing-table `NoSuchTableError`, and system-view filtering (#387)** — three real reflection bugs that the compliance suite's `ComponentReflectionTest` exposed. (1) `get_columns()` never returned column comments because the `_db_attribute` catalog query filtered on `class_name` instead of `class_of.class_name` (a semantic error that was silently swallowed), so every reflected `comment` was `None`; it now uses the correct catalog column. (2) Reflecting a non-existent table via `get_columns()` / `get_indexes()` leaked the raw driver `ProgrammingError` (errno -493, SQLSTATE 42S02) instead of SQLAlchemy's `NoSuchTableError`, which the reflection contract requires; both now translate the "table not found" error. (3) `get_view_names()` returned CUBRID's internal system views (`db_class`, `db_index`, …) alongside user views; it now filters `is_system_class = 'NO'`, matching `get_table_names()`. Together these resolve 22 of the 25 baselined `ComponentReflectionTest` nodes. Also set `requires_name_normalize = False`: CUBRID folds identifiers to **lower** case, not the upper case SQLAlchemy's `denormalized_names` requirement assumes, so `NormalizedNameTest` is now correctly skipped rather than failing (schema case-insensitive matching is unaffected). The remaining 3 `ComponentReflectionTest` nodes (`test_get_noncol_index` ×2, `test_get_view_names[False]`) are SA-harness fixture limitations — the test's own views / non-column-index tables are never created on CUBRID — not dialect bugs.
- **`get_pk_constraint()` no longer drops composite primary-key columns (#426)** — reflecting a table with `PRIMARY KEY (a, b)` returned only `constrained_columns: ['a']`, silently losing every PK column after the first (and giving no column order). Root cause: the reflection scanned `SHOW COLUMNS` for the `PRI` key flag, but CUBRID (MySQL-compatible) marks only the *first* column of a composite PK as `PRI`. The PK columns are now read, in key order, from the `_db_index` / `_db_index_key` system catalog, with a `SHOW COLUMNS` fallback if the catalog query fails. Fixes reflected multi-column-PK ORM mappings and Alembic autogenerate. Found by the new reflection round-trip fuzzer.
- **`executemany` INSERT into a column with a `bind_expression()` CAST no longer sends the wrong parameter count (#421)** — SQLAlchemy's `insertmanyvalues` row-expansion miscounts bind parameters when a target column's type wraps its bind in a `bind_expression` (e.g. a `TypeDecorator` rendering `CAST(? AS VARCHAR(50))`): it emitted 4 placeholders but only 3 parameters (`INSERT ... VALUES (?, CAST(? AS ...)), (?, CAST(? AS ...))` with `(2, 3, 2)`), so the driver raised "wrong number of parameters". The dialect now drops the `insertmanyvalues` plan (in `visit_insert`) for INSERTs targeting such a column, falling back to ordinary DBAPI executemany; single-row inserts and the normal multi-row fast path (columns without a `bind_expression`) are untouched. Fixes the compliance suite's `CastTypeDecoratorTest::test_special_type`.
- **`Identity()` columns now emit `AUTO_INCREMENT`, and DATETIME/TIME microsecond limits are declared to the test suite (#388)** — SQLAlchemy stores an `Identity()` as `column.server_default`, which made the DDL compiler skip its `AUTO_INCREMENT` branch and emit a plain `INTEGER NOT NULL` column, so inserts failed with `Missing value for attribute 'id'`. `Identity()` is now treated as CUBRID's `AUTO_INCREMENT` (its spelling of an identity/autoincrement column). Also declared `datetime_microseconds`/`time_microseconds` as unsupported in `requirements.py` (CUBRID `DATETIME` stores millisecond precision only and `TIME` has no fractional seconds — verified live on 11.4), so the SQLAlchemy compliance suite skips those tests via its own machinery instead of baselining them as xfail. Remaining `#388` triage entries (`DistinctOnTest`, `ReturningGuardsTest`, C-driver-specific `RowCountTest`) are kept as documented xfails with precise root-cause comments; the genuine `CastTypeDecoratorTest` `insertmanyvalues` parameter-count bug is split out to #421.
- **Documented that the legacy `CUBRIDdb` C-extension driver loses `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` fractional precision (#386)** — the C-extension driver (bare `cubrid://`) truncates the fractional part of `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` values *below* the DBAPI layer, returning e.g. `15` for a stored `15.7563`. Because the data is already lost before SQLAlchemy sees it, no dialect result processor can recover it — this is an upstream C-driver limitation, not a dialect bug. The pure-Python `cubrid+pycubrid://` driver returns `Decimal` correctly (verified live on 11.4) and is the recommended driver. The affected `NumericTest` nodes stay baselined in `test/known_failures.txt` with this explanation, and `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` / `docs/TYPES.md` now document the fidelity difference between the two drivers.
- **`ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` referencing `stmt.inserted.col` now fails clearly for inline multi-row `VALUES` instead of a confusing bind error (#371)** — CUBRID has no `VALUES(col)` / row-alias syntax, so the dialect re-emits the INSERT bind parameter to reference the inserted value. That works for a single-row `INSERT` and for executemany (each execution is logically single-row), but for an inline multi-row `insert(t).values([{...}, {...}])` there is no single value to bind per conflicting row — the previous code raised a misleading `cannot resolve INSERT bind parameter ... Ensure the column is included in the INSERT values` (the column *was* included). It now raises a clear `CompileError` naming the CUBRID limitation and pointing to executemany, single-row statements, a literal/expression update, or `MERGE`. Nested references (e.g. `func.coalesce(stmt.inserted.col, ...)`) are caught too; literal/expression updates that do not reference the inserted value keep compiling for multi-row inserts. Refusing to compile avoids the silent-corruption trap of binding one row's value for every conflicting row.
- **`OFFSET` without `LIMIT` no longer silently caps result sets at ~1.07B rows (#414)** — a bare `.offset(n)` compiled to `LIMIT n, 1073741823`, reusing CUBRID's VARCHAR-length constant (2^30-1) as the row-count sentinel. That is a string-length bound, not a legal upper bound for a `LIMIT` row count, so a query with an offset and no limit was silently truncated at 1,073,741,823 rows (wrong results, no error) on tables past that size. The sentinel is now `2^62` (`4611686018427387904`) — effectively unbounded (~4.6×10^18 rows). It is deliberately **not** the signed BIGINT maximum (2^63-1): CUBRID computes `offset + row_count` internally and overflow-checks it, so a BIGINT-max sentinel raises `ERROR -458 (Overflow occurred in addition context)` for any positive offset (caught by the SQLAlchemy compliance suite's `FetchLimitOffsetTest`). 2^62 leaves ~4.6×10^18 rows of offset headroom before the sum can overflow. Named the value `_CUBRID_OFFSET_NO_LIMIT_ROW_COUNT` in `compiler.py`, and the regression test now asserts on the constant (and that the old 2^30-1 cap is gone) instead of the bare literal.
- **Numeric bind parameters keep their scale in arithmetic, and FROM-less `SELECT ... WHERE` compiles (#386)** — CUBRID coerces a bound parameter in `NUMERIC(p,s) + ?` arithmetic to an integer, silently dropping the fractional scale (a SQL literal or an explicit CAST keeps it). Scaled `NUMERIC`/`DECIMAL` binds now render `CAST(? AS NUMERIC(p,s))` so the scale is preserved; unconstrained `Numeric()` binds are left untouched (CUBRID's bare `NUMERIC` is scale 0 — specify precision/scale for exact decimals). Also added a `default_from()` of ` FROM db_root` (CUBRID's `DUAL` equivalent) so a FROM-less `SELECT` carrying a `WHERE` clause no longer raises a syntax error.
- **`supports_is_distinct_from` / `supports_native_enum` now report their real capabilities (#381, #382)** — both flags were `False`, which made SQLAlchemy's official suite skip `IsOrIsNotDistinctFromTest` and the native-enum tests even though both features are fully implemented (IS DISTINCT FROM emulation via `<=>` from #345/#377; native `ENUM(...)` DDL). Flipped both to `True`; the previously-skipped suite tests now run and pass live on CUBRID 11.4 (5 IS DISTINCT FROM + native-enum cases, zero regressions). Also corrected the `ENUM` docstring, which wrongly claimed `native_enum=False` is "ignored" — it correctly emits `VARCHAR(n)` per the SQLAlchemy contract (verified live).
- **SQLAlchemy dialect compliance suite now gates CI (#380)** — the `test_suite.py` step ran with a trailing `|| true` and, worse, had no `[sqla_testing]` config, so the official SQLAlchemy suite crashed at session start (`configparser.NoSectionError`) and CI silently ignored it — the suite had never actually run. Added `setup.cfg` with the required `[sqla_testing]` section, removed `|| true`, and gated the suite on the representative Python 3.14 × CUBRID 11.4 cell. Added `has_temp_table`/`temp_table_reflection` requirement exclusions in `requirements.py` (CUBRID has no temp tables), which eliminated 732 setup errors. The remaining genuine failures are pinned as a strict-xfail baseline in `test/known_failures.txt` (loaded by `conftest.py`): any new failure fails CI, and fixing a baselined test forces its removal from the manifest. The baseline is SQLAlchemy-version-specific (suite parametrization changes between releases), so the gating cell pins `sqlalchemy==2.0.53` and `conftest.py` fails the gating run (`CUBRID_STRICT_KNOWN_FAILURES=1`) if any manifest entry no longer matches a collected test. Follow-up bug trackers: #385 (view DDL), #386 (Numeric/Decimal), #387 (reflection), #388 (misc).
- **`IS DISTINCT FROM` live execution fixed (#377)** — live CUBRID rejects MySQL-style `NOT (a <=> b)` when the expression appears in a SELECT projection. The emulation now negates the NULL-safe `<=>` result as `(a <=> b) = 0`, which preserves the four-row SQL truth table and is valid CUBRID syntax. Added live truth-table coverage for both `IS DISTINCT FROM` and `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`.
- **create-release.yml: dropped `--target` from `gh release create`** — with an already-pushed tag (the normal tag-push trigger) `--verify-tag` already guarantees the tag exists, and passing `target_commitish` for an existing tag makes the Releases API return `422 Validation Failed`, so the first tag-triggered run of this workflow always failed. Verified live by the v0.4.0 tag attempt in cubrid-mcp-server.

### Docs
- **Demo GIF embedded in README** — auto-generated terminal demo showing create_engine → connect → execute → result.
- **Korean/multi-language docs governance** — every `docs/README.<lang>.md` translation now carries a sync marker, and docs-sync gained a `translation-sync` job that fails a PR when `README.md` changes without any translation changing (escape hatch: the `translations-deferred` label).

- **Docs site information architecture unified across the ecosystem** — nav reorganized to the shared six-tab skeleton (Home / Getting Started / Usage / Reference / Operations / Project), the five README translations (ko/de/hi/ru/zh) are now reachable via Project → Translations (previously URL-only), palette unified to blue with search-suggest, and the homepage gains an Ecosystem section linking the three sibling sites.
- **CUBRID-Python BSD basis documented, server-license line added, NOTICE created, copyright unified (#333)** — `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` now records that the optional CUBRID-Python extra's `BSD` claim rests on PyPI metadata and setup.py (the upstream repository ships no LICENSE file or headers; 2- vs 3-Clause unspecified), and carries the verified CUBRID server licensing statement (engine Apache-2.0, APIs/connectors BSD per upstream `COPYING` — GPL v2+ is outdated). Added a two-line `NOTICE` (independent implementation, no third-party code). LICENSE copyright unified to `Yeongseon Choe, Gyeongjun Paik` (2021-2026).

### Docs
- **Added `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md` and a Provenance section in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — the license inventory covers the default runtime tree (SQLAlchemy, greenlet, typing_extensions) and the optional `[alembic]`/`[cubrid]` extras; the provenance note states that this dialect is an independent implementation, not a port of the legacy `CUBRID-Python`-bundled dialect. Documentation only.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-02

### Docs
- **Documented that CUBRID's `LIST` collection type is a synonym for `SEQUENCE`** — CUBRID accepts `LIST(type)` in DDL but normalizes it to `SEQUENCE` at parse time, so a `LIST(INTEGER)` column is stored and reflected as `SEQUENCE OF INTEGER` (verified on live CUBRID 11.2). Clarified in `docs/TYPES.md` and via a code comment in `ischema_names` why the dialect exposes only the canonical `SEQUENCE` type and deliberately omits a `LIST` type/reflection entry (a type compiling to `LIST(...)` would produce spurious Alembic autogenerate diffs against the reflected `SEQUENCE(...)`). No behavior change.
- **Documented canonical isolation-level names on read-back (#293)** — clarified that `get_isolation_level()` returns the *canonical* name for a level, which may differ from the alias passed to `set_isolation_level()` (CUBRID accepts several aliases per numeric level). Added a note to `docs/ISOLATION_LEVELS.md` and the `get_isolation_level()` docstring. Behavior is unchanged; the reverse mapping was already correct.
- **Aligned the `Documentation` project URL with the README docs badge (#294)** — `pyproject.toml` pointed `Documentation` at the repo tree (`.../tree/main/docs`) while the README badge pointed at the published site `https://cubrid-lab.github.io/sqlalchemy-cubrid/`. Both now use the published site so PyPI metadata and the README agree.
- **Documented the `[cubrid]` install extra in the README (#295)** — the optional `cubrid = ["CUBRID-Python"]` extra (the legacy C-extension driver used by the bare `cubrid://` URL) was declared in `pyproject.toml` but undocumented. Added a README installation note explaining what it installs and clarifying that the pure-Python `[pycubrid]` driver remains the recommended driver for new projects.
- **Realigned the SQLAlchemy version-support narrative from "2.0–2.2" to "2.0–2.1" (#312)** — README (+5 locale docs), `docs/index.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/QUICKSTART.md`, `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md`, `docs/CONNECTION.md`, `docs/SA_COMPAT.md`, and `ROADMAP.md` claimed support for a non-existent SQLAlchemy 2.2 line, contradicting `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md` (which correctly lists 2.1.x as the latest tested version and ≥2.2 as unsupported). SQLAlchemy's next feature line is 2.1, not 2.2 — PyPI ships only `2.1.0b1/b2/b3` pre-releases. Historical CHANGELOG entries are left intact as an accurate record.
### Changed
- **`is_disconnect()` hardened against pycubrid error-message wording drift (#314)** — connection-pool invalidation detection now anchors first on stable numeric error codes and then on an `OSError` in the exception's explicit `__cause__` chain (cycle-guarded), demoting substring matching of error *messages* to a last-resort fallback. Previously detection was primarily message-based, so a change to pycubrid's wording of a socket/transport failure could silently stop a dead connection from being recycled (stale connection served to the next checkout). Added pycubrid's `-4` (`ER_COMMUNICATION` / SQLSTATE `08S01`) to the known disconnect codes alongside the existing `-21003/-21005/-10005/-10007`. Detection stays conservative to avoid false-positive pool invalidation: only the *explicit* `raise ... from` cause chain is followed (implicit `__context__` is ignored, so an unrelated in-flight `OSError` does not invalidate a live connection), and a bare `OperationalError`/`InterfaceError` with no disconnect code, no `OSError` cause, and a non-disconnect message (e.g. `"invalid isolation level"`, a closed-cursor misuse) is *not* treated as a disconnect. The legacy string-match list is retained as the fallback for the CUBRIDdb C-extension driver (which lacks `OperationalError`) and for pycubrid's client-side string-only errors (e.g. `"connection lost during receive"`, which carries neither a code nor an `OSError` cause). Added offline regression tests covering the `-4` code, explicit-cause `OSError` detection, implicit-`__context__` non-detection, non-`OSError`-cause message fallback, and non-disconnect `OperationalError`/`InterfaceError` cases.
- **Ruff lint rule selection now declared explicitly (#271)** — `pyproject.toml` configured ruff but never set `[tool.ruff.lint] select`, so `ruff check` inherited ruff's implicit defaults. Ruff expanded that default set in 0.16 (59 → 413 rules against this repo's config), which is why #267 (`0.15.21 → 0.16.2`) failed lint with 151 errors in untouched code. Pinning the ruff *version* in #252 stopped unpinned installs from drifting, but could not survive the bump itself — the rule set is now pinned too, via `select = ["E4", "E7", "E9", "F"]`, which is exactly what ruff selected by default through 0.15.x (same 59 rules under both versions).

### Added
- **Native ENUM type support (#343)** — `sqlalchemy_cubrid.ENUM` renders `ENUM('a', 'b', ...)` DDL. Plain `sa.Enum` maps to native ENUM via colspecs. Reflection parses the element list from `SHOW COLUMNS`. Verified live on CUBRID 10.2, 11.0, 11.4 (the docs previously and wrongly claimed CUBRID has no ENUM).
- **`IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` emulation (#344)** — CUBRID lacks the SQL-standard syntax but supports the null-safe equal `<=>`. The dialect now renders `NOT (a <=> b)` / `a <=> b` — the same approach the MySQL dialect uses.
- **New explicit `cubrid+cubriddb://` URL and `[cubriddb]` install extra for the legacy CUBRIDdb driver (#276)** — the legacy `CUBRIDdb` C-extension driver (the driver bound to the bare `cubrid://` URL) can now be selected unambiguously via the explicit `cubrid+cubriddb://` URL, backed by a matching `cubriddb = ["CUBRID-Python"]` install extra. The bare `cubrid://` URL continues to bind CUBRIDdb — no behavior change to any existing URL. For new projects the pure-Python `pycubrid` driver is the recommended choice: install `sqlalchemy-cubrid[pycubrid]` and use `cubrid+pycubrid://` (installs with pip alone, no C toolchain).
- **Native Alembic `ALTER COLUMN` type changes and column renames (#305)** — `CubridImpl.alter_column()` previously raised `NotImplementedError` for column type changes and renames, forcing every such migration through `batch_alter_table` (full table recreate). CUBRID in fact supports MySQL-compatible `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY`, `CHANGE`, and `RENAME COLUMN`, so the dialect now emits native DDL: a type change compiles to `MODIFY`, a rename to `RENAME COLUMN ... TO ...`, and a combined rename + type change to a single `CHANGE`. Type conversions are governed by the server's `alter_table_change_type_strict` system parameter (incompatible/truncating conversions error when `yes`, may silently truncate when `no`); `batch_alter_table` remains available as a fallback for genuinely lossy conversions. Added SQL-emission tests covering all three DDL forms.

### Fixed
- **`is_disconnect()` now actually recognizes pycubrid's `"connection lost during receive"` message (#322)** — the #314 hardening documented (in both the CHANGELOG and the `is_disconnect()` docstring) that pycubrid's client-side `"connection lost during receive"` string was covered by the message fallback, but the pattern was never added to `_disconnect_messages`. pycubrid raises this on a clean-EOF receive (`connection.py` sync path) with **no** numeric error code and **no** `OSError` cause, so all three detection layers missed it and SQLAlchemy failed to invalidate the dead connection — a stale connection could be served to the next pool checkout. Added the substring `"connection lost"` to `_disconnect_messages` so the message fallback matches. Added an offline regression test asserting `is_disconnect()` returns `True` for a bare driver error carrying only that message.
- **`SELECT SCHEMA()` returning NULL no longer leaks the fake schema `"None"` (#290)** — `_get_default_schema_name()` did `str(connection.execute(text("SELECT SCHEMA()")).scalar())`, so when `SCHEMA()` returned SQL NULL the Python `None` was stringified to the literal `"None"`. Because `get_schema_names()` and `_schema_is_default()` test the value against the `None` object (not the string), that fake name leaked through as a real schema (`get_schema_names()` → `["None"]`). `_get_default_schema_name()` now returns `Optional[str]` — `None` when `SCHEMA()` is NULL, otherwise the real name — so `get_schema_names()` correctly returns `[]` with no default schema. This pins the default-schema contract used by the follow-up schema-guard fixes.
- **Literal rendering no longer doubles backslashes, silently corrupting data on a default CUBRID (#313)** — `CubridSQLCompiler.render_literal_value()` unconditionally did `rendered.replace("\\", "\\\\")`, doubling every backslash in inline SQL literals. This is correct for MySQL but **wrong for CUBRID**, whose `no_backslash_escapes` system parameter defaults to `yes` — a backslash is a literal character, not an escape. On a default server this silently corrupted any backslash-bearing literal rendered via `literal_binds=True` (e.g. `C:\temp` was stored/compared as two backslashes), affecting DML literals, JSON inline path literals (`types.py`), and DDL `COMMENT` clauses (table/column comments, Alembic column comments). Verified empirically on live CUBRID 11.2 and against the official docs (default `no_backslash_escapes=yes`), and consistent with sibling driver pycubrid, which negotiates this per-connection. The compiler now preserves backslashes by default. A new `CubridDialect(no_backslash_escapes=False)` option restores the legacy doubling for the rare server explicitly configured with `no_backslash_escapes=no` (backslash-as-escape); it is a static dialect option because `literal_binds` compilation may run offline with no live connection. **Migration note:** databases written by an affected version may already contain unintended doubled backslashes in literal-rendered data — audit such rows if you relied on inline literals. Added compiler, JSON, DDL-comment, and live-roundtrip regression tests.
- **Object-detail reflection now raises `NoSuchTableError` for a non-default schema (#291)** — the shared `_schema_is_default()` guard was only applied to list/existence methods (`get_table_names`, `get_view_names`, `has_table`, `has_index`), so object-detail methods (`get_columns`, `get_pk_constraint`, `get_foreign_keys`, `get_indexes`, `get_unique_constraints`, `get_view_definition`, `get_table_comment`) silently ignored `schema=` and returned metadata from the default schema — masking the fact that CUBRID exposes a single effective schema per connection. Those seven methods now call a new `_raise_if_non_default_schema()` helper that raises `NoSuchTableError("<schema>.<object>")` when `schema=` is not the default, matching SQLite's behaviour and preventing a real "object not found" from being hidden behind empty metadata. List/existence methods keep returning empty/false via `_schema_is_default()`.
- **Schema-default comparison is now case-insensitive (#292)** — `_schema_is_default()` compared `schema == self.default_schema_name` with a plain, case-sensitive `==`. CUBRID reports catalog names uppercased (`DBA`) while SQLAlchemy normalizes to lower case, so `MetaData.reflect(schema="dba")` (or any case-mismatched schema argument) failed the guard and was treated as a foreign schema — yielding no reflection or a spurious `NoSuchTableError`. The guard now normalizes both sides via `self.normalize_name()` (the dialect's own identifier rules), so `"dba"`, `"DBA"`, and the reported default all compare equal. Names the user explicitly quoted (`quoted_name` with `quote=True`) are still compared case-sensitively, honouring the intent to preserve case.
- **Schema reflection is now internally consistent (#280)** — `get_schema_names()` previously returned `[]` with the docstring "CUBRID does not support schemas", directly contradicting `_get_default_schema_name()` (which returns a real schema via `SELECT SCHEMA()`), and the `schema=` argument was handled differently per method: `get_table_names` returned `[]` for a non-default schema while `get_view_names`/`has_table`/`has_index` ignored the argument entirely — so `MetaData.reflect(schema=<x>)` produced a contradictory "0 tables + all views". The dialect now operates in a consistent single-schema mode: `get_schema_names()` returns `[default_schema_name]`, and a shared `_schema_is_default()` guard makes `get_table_names`, `get_view_names`, `has_table`, and `has_index` honour `schema=` uniformly (the default schema is reflected; any other schema yields nothing). Owner-qualified cross-schema reflection is intentionally not attempted. Verified against live CUBRID 11.2.
- **Isolation-level `set` → `get` round-trip is now symmetric (#281)** — `get_isolation_level()` previously returned only the long granular spelling per code (setting `"REPEATABLE READ"` came back as `"REPEATABLE READ SCHEMA, REPEATABLE READ INSTANCES"`; `"READ COMMITTED"` / `"CURSOR STABILITY"` came back as the long form), so the short standard names a user passes in were never returned — a mismatch SQLAlchemy compares on pool return/reset. `_ISOLATION_LEVEL_REVERSE` now returns one canonical name per integer code: the short standard names for `READ COMMITTED` (4), `REPEATABLE READ` (5), and `SERIALIZABLE` (6), and the granular spelling for levels 1–3 (which have no short name). Aliases still collapse onto their canonical code, so `set` → `get` round-trips to the same level for every accepted input name. `reset_isolation_level()` and the `None`-row fallback now use the canonical `"READ COMMITTED"`. Added offline round-trip tests plus live CUBRID verification.
- **Obsolete pre-MVCC isolation levels (1–3) removed from the accepted set (#307)** — the dialect's `_ISOLATION_LEVEL_MAP` and `get_isolation_level_values()` still advertised the four legacy granular levels that CUBRID's MVCC engine (10.0+) removed. On a modern server (verified against live CUBRID 11.2.9) `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL 1|2|3` is rejected with *"Isolation level value in MVCC must be 'read committed', 'repeatable read' or 'serializable'"*, so any name resolving to codes 1–3 could only ever fail at the server. Those three names (`REPEATABLE READ SCHEMA, READ UNCOMMITTED INSTANCES`, `READ COMMITTED SCHEMA, READ COMMITTED INSTANCES`, `READ COMMITTED SCHEMA, READ UNCOMMITTED INSTANCES`) now raise a clear client-side `ValueError` instead. The dialect keeps the three supported MVCC levels — `READ COMMITTED` (4), `REPEATABLE READ` (5), `SERIALIZABLE` (6) — plus the still-valid aliases (`CURSOR STABILITY` and the two long spellings that map to 4/5). `_ISOLATION_LEVEL_REVERSE` drops the dead 1–3 entries while `get_isolation_level()` stays tolerant of any unexpected server value via its string fallback. `docs/ISOLATION_LEVELS.md` rewritten to document the three MVCC levels and the historical removal.
- **Lint job red on `main` (#268)** — `#257` removed the only use of `re` in `test/test_packaging.py` but left `import re` behind, so `ruff check sqlalchemy_cubrid/ test/` failed with `F401` and took `matrix-result` down with it. Removed the orphaned import.

### CI
- **Async integration jobs now install pycubrid via the declared `[pycubrid]` extra instead of an unpinned bare `pip install pycubrid` (#318)** — `ci.yml` and `integration-full.yml` installed pycubrid for the async integration step with a bare `pip install pycubrid`, which ignored the project's declared support range (`[pycubrid]` extra = `pycubrid>=1.3.2,<2.0`) and could silently pull an out-of-range release (e.g. a future `2.0`). Both steps now run `pip install -e ".[pycubrid]"`, honoring the constraint (the redundant `pytest-asyncio` install was also dropped — it already ships in the `[dev]` extra installed earlier in the job). Clarified intent in-workflow: these jobs are **release verification** (validate against a supported *released* driver); cross-package testing against pycubrid@main (HEAD) remains the dedicated job in `upstream-canary.yml`. CI-only change; no runtime or packaging behavior change.
- **`sqlalchemy-22-canary` pin was unsatisfiable; retargeted to SA 2.1 and renamed (#312)** — the canary installed `--pre "sqlalchemy>=2.2.0b1,<2.3"`, but no `2.2.x` release exists on PyPI (SQLAlchemy's next line is 2.1, latest stable `2.0.52`), so the job failed at the install step on every PR and `main` and never actually ran. It now installs `--pre "SQLAlchemy>=2.1.0b1,<2.3"` and the job is renamed `sqlalchemy-21-canary`. It remains `continue-on-error: true` (non-gating). This reverts the incorrect #231 "bump" (which assumed `2.1.0b1` was no longer a pre-release) and restores the intent of #206.
- **`upstream-canary` now exercises the online/integration suite against `pycubrid@main`, and the Alembic autogenerate patch target is version-robust (#323)** — despite #319, no CI path actually ran the *integration* tests against pycubrid git HEAD: `ci.yml` and `integration-full.yml` install the released `[pycubrid]` range, and `upstream-canary.yml` pinned HEAD but ran offline tests only. Cross-stack fixes landing in pycubrid `main` were therefore never exercised end-to-end. Added a second `upstream-canary-integration` job that spins up a CUBRID 11.4 service, installs `pycubrid@main`, and runs `test_integration.py` + `test_aio_integration.py` (both `continue-on-error: true`, non-gating). Separately, `test/test_alembic.py` and `test/test_alembic_roundtrip.py` patched `alembic.autogenerate.compare.schema.inspect`, but in alembic ≥1.14 `compare` is a module (not a package) with `inspect` bound at module level, raising `ModuleNotFoundError` (4 local failures). The patch target is now resolved at runtime against the installed alembic layout, and the `alembic` constraint is tightened to `>=1.7,<2.0` to bound future API drift. CI/test-only change; no runtime or packaging behavior change.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- **`bind_with_type` private API insulation (#231)** — `bind_with_type()` in `_compat.py` called `element._clone()` without a guard. If SQLAlchemy renames or removes `_clone()` in a future release (e.g. 2.2+), the dialect would crash with `AttributeError`. Added `try/except AttributeError` fallback that constructs a fresh `BindParameter` with the same key, value, type, and unique flag. This path only fires if SA changes the private API; the existing `_clone()` path remains the primary code path for SA 2.0–2.1.
- **PK constraint name reflection fixed (#120)** — `get_pk_constraint()` queried the non-existent `db_constraint` system view (CUBRID has no such view in any version), causing the PK constraint name to always be `None` in production. The query now targets `_db_index` (`is_primary_key = 1`), the authoritative system catalog for index metadata. Constraint names like `pk_users` are now correctly reflected.
- **Unique constraint reflection hardened via system catalog (#120)** — `get_unique_constraints()` now queries `_db_index` (`is_unique = 1`, excluding PK/FK auto-indexes) and resolves column names via `SHOW INDEXES` as the primary path, with the DDL regex as a fallback. This eliminates brittle regex parsing when the system catalog is available, matching the proven pattern already used by `get_indexes()`.

### Changed
- **FK reflection code extracted into testable helper (#120)** — `_get_foreign_keys_from_ddl()` is now a standalone method. CUBRID system catalog views do not expose FK referenced-table/column metadata, so DDL parsing remains the sole FK reflection path. The extraction improves unit test isolation.

### CI
- **SA 2.2 canary bumped (#231)** — the `sqlalchemy-22-canary` CI job now installs `sqlalchemy>=2.2.0b1` (was `>=2.1.0b1`, which is no longer a pre-release). Added `continue-on-error: true` so canary failures warn but don't gate PRs — pre-release breakage is expected and shouldn't block development.
- **CI lint now uses pinned ruff version (#252)** — the lint job used `pip install ruff` (unpinned). Now installs from `.[dev]` extras to match the pinned `ruff==0.15.21` in `pyproject.toml`.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- **RETURNING now raises explicit `CompileError` (#229)** — the dialect previously set `insert_returning = update_returning = delete_returning = False` and silently fell back to `LAST_INSERT_ID()` for any `.returning()` call. Users had no signal that RETURNING wasn't actually executing server-side. `visit_insert`/`visit_update`/`visit_delete` now check `stmt._returning` before compilation and raise `CompileError` pointing to `result.inserted_primary_key` as the auto-increment PK retrieval path.
- **Two-phase commit explicitly disabled (#230)** — `supports_twophase_commit = False` added to `CubridDialect`, and `two_phase_transactions` is now a `_CLOSED` requirement flag in `requirements.py` so the SA test suite properly skips two-phase tests.
## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- **SQLAlchemy 2.1 / forward-compat shims for SA 2.2 (#206)** — dependency upper bound bumped to `<2.3` (now `sqlalchemy>=2.0,<2.3`), enabling installation on SA 2.1 and future 2.2 releases. New `CubridCompiler.update_post_criteria_clause` override routes the existing `cubrid_limit` LIMIT rendering through the SA 2.1 hook that replaced `update_limit_clause`. `_render_json_extract_from_binary` now recognises `Float` as a numeric affinity since SA 2.1 split it out of `Numeric`, restoring `CAST(... AS DOUBLE)` emission for `JSON[...].as_float()`. `AsyncAdapt_pycubrid_connection.await_` is redeclared as a class-level staticmethod because SA 2.1 dropped the inherited attribute on `AsyncAdapt_dbapi_connection`. Cross-version offline test suite (639 tests) green on both SA 2.0.49 and SA 2.1.0b2.
- **`sqlalchemy-22-canary` CI job promoted to gating (#206)** — previously `continue-on-error: true` against a non-existent `sqlalchemy>=2.2.0b1`. Now installs `--pre "sqlalchemy>=2.1.0b1,<2.3"` so the job actually exercises the latest available SA pre-release and fails the build on regressions.

### Fixed
- **Async integration stability for issue #208** — `test/test_aio_integration.py` now seeds per-test data instead of relying on module-shared CRUD state, adds live `pool_pre_ping=True` recovery coverage after an internal async transport drop, and verifies async SQLAlchemy INSERT returns `lastrowid` without adding a new `AsyncAdapt_pycubrid_connection.get_last_insert_id()` passthrough because async pycubrid already populates `cursor.lastrowid` and the dialect retains SQL fallback.

### Validated
- **Native pycubrid ping causally validated** — Tier 2 ORM benchmark in [cubrid-benchmark`2026-04-22_native-ping-hotpath`](https://github.com/cubrid-lab/cubrid-benchmark/tree/main/experiments/orm-overhead/runs/2026-04-22_native-ping-hotpath) (paired same-version A/B, 7 trials, bootstrap 95% CI) confirms `do_ping()` native CHECK_CAS path delivers a practical pre-ping hot-path win: SQLAlchemy Core `checkout_select_by_pk` +108.2% throughput [+107.8, +109.6], ORM `session_select_by_pk` +42.1% [+41.8, +43.9], with p50/p95 latency also reduced. Effect applies to short-lived checkout/session workloads with `pool_pre_ping=True` (typical web request pattern); steady-state long-connection workloads are unaffected.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- **`visit_double` alias** — forward compatibility with SQLAlchemy 2.1 which compiles `Double` via `visit_double()` (#206)
- **MERGE column resolution docs** — column resolution rules and error reference added to `DML_EXTENSIONS.md` (#207)
- **Collection member split tests** — `_split_collection_members` unit tests with paren-depth guard (#204)

### Fixed
- **Paren-depth-aware collection member split** — reflection now correctly splits nested generic types like `NUMERIC(15,2)` inside `SET`/`MULTISET`/`SEQUENCE` (#204)
- **Collection member type params preserved** — compilation and reflection retain precision/scale for parameterized member types (#194)
- **Oracle review fixes** — type args, timezone semantics, and regression test gaps addressed (#203)

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Native pycubrid ping for pooling** — both sync and async pycubrid dialects now use native `Connection.ping()` / `AsyncConnection.ping()` (`CHECK_CAS`, FC=32) in `do_ping()` for lower `pool_pre_ping` latency (~0.5–2ms instead of ~2–10ms query round trips) (#149, pycubrid#70, pycubrid#95)
- **pycubrid extra floor raised** — `sqlalchemy-cubrid[pycubrid]` now requires `pycubrid>=1.3.2,<2.0` so sync and async `pool_pre_ping` share the same native ping contract

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Docs-only patch release** — aligns Beta-era documentation without runtime or packaging code changes
- **Oracle audit fixes** — clarified reflection internals, `postfetch_lastrowid` behavior, SQLAlchemy private API dependency coverage, type reflection notes, and `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` semantics
- **PRD and development docs alignment** — resolved internal contradictions across guide counts, entry points, CI matrix details, and unreachable-line notes
- **README translation sync** — refreshed Korean, German, Russian, Chinese, and Hindi READMEs to match the English baseline

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **SQLAlchemy 2.2 compatibility shim** — `sqlalchemy_cubrid/_compat.py` insulates compiler from SA private API changes (`is_literal_value`, `bind_with_type`, `for_update_arg`, `limit_clause`, `offset_clause`). `bind_with_type` now preserves `expanding`/`literal_execute`/`isoutparam` flags; `is_literal_value` handles `visitors.Visitable` instances (Oracle post-review fixes) (#142)
- **Alembic safety checklist + advisory CLI** — `docs/ALEMBIC.md` adds Pre-Migration Checklist, Pre-Deploy Sequence, and Rollback Template; `scripts/alembic_safety_check.py` provides advisory detection for non-transactional DDL risks (#144)
- **Compiler benchmark baseline** — `scripts/bench_compile.py` per-construct timing baseline. Baselines: SELECT+LIMIT ~178µs, INSERT ~129µs, INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ~234µs (1.8× simple INSERT due to `replacement_traverse` overhead), SELECT FOR UPDATE ~153µs (#145)
- **QueuePool concurrency stress tests** — 6 tests covering sync concurrent checkouts within `pool_size`, overflow burst absorption with barrier sync, `pool_timeout` exhaustion, `pool_recycle` aged-connection replacement, async `gather` within `pool_size`, async overflow burst

### Fixed
- **pycubrid dependency pin** — `pycubrid>=1.2.0,<2.0` (was missing upper bound) (#143)
- **F401 lint regression** — removed unused `CubridDialect` import in `test/test_logging.py`

### Deferred
- **SA 2.2 compatibility** — remains pinned to `<2.2` per existing limitation; the compat shim prepares the codebase for the future bump but does not lift the pin

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- **FK parsing with ON DELETE/ON UPDATE** — `get_foreign_keys()` regex now captures referential action clauses from `SHOW CREATE TABLE` (#135)
- **Multi-table UPDATE** — `UPDATE ... JOIN ... SET` syntax support via `CubridSQLCompiler` (#137)
- **FULL OUTER JOIN / LATERAL rejection** — raises `CompileError` for unsupported join types instead of generating invalid SQL (#138)
- **`get_check_constraints()`** — returns empty list with documentation that CUBRID parses but ignores CHECK constraints (#139)
- **Alembic `alter_column` guardrails** — `CubridImpl.alter_column()` rejects `type_`/`new_column_name` with clear error, allows `nullable`/`server_default` (#136)
- **Distribution smoke test** — CI validates sdist/wheel build (#122)
- **Entry point verification test** — importlib.metadata check for dialect registration (#123)
- **Release consistency CI** — automated tag/version/changelog alignment checks (#124)
- **SHOW CREATE TABLE golden tests** — parsing fixture corpus for DDL reflection (#125)
- **Alembic autogenerate regression tests** — false-positive diff detection (#126)
- **Reflection fallback logging** — silent errors in dialect.py now logged (#127)
- **Async integration tests in CI** — promoted from optional to regular (#130)
- **CUBRID version-specific reflection snapshots** — DDL output tests across versions (#134)
- **SA_COMPAT.md** — documents SQLAlchemy private API dependencies and 2.2 readiness plan (#132)

### Fixed
- **`has_index()` bug** — now filters by `class_of.class_name` to avoid cross-table false positives
- **`reset_isolation_level()`** — uses canonical isolation level name instead of alias
- **`get_isolation_level()` fallback** — returns canonical `"READ COMMITTED"` instead of driver-specific alias (#140)

### Changed
- **Status: Beta** — README, classifiers, and documentation now consistently use Beta messaging; removed "stable", "production-ready", "frozen" language
- **README consolidation** — authoritative support contract with async status and known limitations (#128)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md / DEVELOPMENT.md refresh** — updated to reflect current module structure (#129)
- **Reflection diagnostic guide** — troubleshooting for Alembic autogenerate issues (#131)
- **Compiler DML helper extraction** — cleaner `visit_on_duplicate_key_update`/`visit_merge` (#133)
- **pycubrid (sync) compatibility** — now requires `>=1.2.0` for full feature parity

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Re-release of 1.2.2** from current `main` HEAD. The `v1.2.2` git tag
  unintentionally pointed to an older commit (pre-async-dialect, pre-#120 fix),
  so the PyPI 1.2.2 artifact shipped without the #120 fix and was missing the
  `cubrid.pycubrid` and `cubrid.aiopycubrid` entry points. **PyPI 1.2.2 has been
  yanked**; please upgrade to 1.2.3.
- No source code changes vs. `main` — same fixes as listed under [1.2.2] below,
  now actually shipped to PyPI.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Alembic autogenerate false-positive diffs** (#120):
  - `get_indexes()` now filters out the implicit indexes that CUBRID auto-creates
    for every primary-key and foreign-key constraint.  These auto-indexes
    previously caused Alembic to emit spurious `op.drop_index` /
    `op.create_index` operations on every `alembic check` / `revision --autogenerate`
    run.  The dialect now batch-queries `_db_index.is_primary_key` and
    `_db_index.is_foreign_key` (single round trip) and excludes flagged indexes
    from the reflection result.
  - `get_foreign_keys()` rewritten to parse `SHOW CREATE TABLE` output.  The
    previous implementation queried the `db_constraint` view, which is **not**
    queryable in CUBRID 11.x (despite older docs referencing it) and silently
    returned an empty list — leaving Alembic blind to every existing FK and
    causing it to schedule recreation on every run.
  - `get_unique_constraints()` rewritten to parse `SHOW CREATE TABLE` output
    for the same reason as `get_foreign_keys()`.
- **`compare_type` for unbounded VARCHAR**: `CubridImpl.compare_type()` now
  treats CUBRID's `VARCHAR(1073741823)` (the physical storage for `STRING`,
  `CLOB`, `TEXT`, and `String` without a length) as equivalent to SQLAlchemy's
  `Text()`, `CLOB()`, and `String()` (no length), eliminating false-positive
  type-change diffs in Alembic autogenerate.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- **Async dialect**: Add missing `get_pool_class()` override returning
  `AsyncAdaptedQueuePool` — `create_async_engine()` now works correctly (#116)
- **JSON serialization**: Initialize `_json_serializer` / `_json_deserializer`
  attributes in `CubridDialect.__init__()` — ORM `JSON` column inserts no
  longer raise `AttributeError` (#117)

### Added

- 16 async E2E integration tests (`test/test_aio_integration.py`)
- Async usage sample (`samples/async_basic.py`)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **JSON type support** (CUBRID 10.2+)
  - `JSON` type class subclassing `sqltypes.JSON`
  - `JSONIndexType` and `JSONPathType` for path expression formatting
    (with embedded-quote escaping per CUBRID JSON path grammar)
  - `visit_JSON` type compiler emitting `JSON` DDL
  - JSON path expressions via `JSON_EXTRACT` (`col["key"]`, `col[("a", "b")]`)
  - Typed access via `as_boolean`, `as_integer`, `as_numeric`, `as_float`, `as_string`
    using CASE / CAST / `JSON_UNQUOTE` as appropriate
  - JSON null → SQL NULL handling with CASE expressions for typed access
  - `colspecs` mapping: generic `sa.JSON` → dialect `JSON`
  - `ischema_names` mapping: `"JSON"` → `JSON` for reflection
  - 47 offline tests (`test/test_json.py`)

### Fixed

- Version consistency: synchronized `__version__` in `sqlalchemy_cubrid/__init__.py`
  with `pyproject.toml` (was 1.0.0 vs 1.1.0)
- Removed unused imports flagged by `ruff` in `aio_pycubrid_dialect.py` and
  `test/test_aio_pycubrid_dialect.py`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Async dialect** via `cubrid+aiopycubrid://` URL scheme
  - `PyCubridAsyncDialect` (`is_async=True`) using SQLAlchemy's `AsyncAdapt_dbapi_*` base classes
  - `AsyncAdapt_pycubrid_dbapi` wraps `pycubrid.aio` module
  - `AsyncAdapt_pycubrid_connection` bridges autocommit via greenlet `await_only`
  - `AsyncAdapt_pycubrid_cursor` with full async cursor adaptation
  - `cubrid.aiopycubrid` entry point auto-discovered by SQLAlchemy
- 17 new async dialect offline tests (`test/test_aio_pycubrid_dialect.py`)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-11

### Compatibility Policy

This release establishes the 1.x compatibility contract: the public API follows semantic versioning,
and breaking changes will only occur in major version bumps (2.0+).

### Supported Environments

- **Python**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
- **CUBRID**: 10.2, 11.0, 11.2, 11.4
- **SQLAlchemy**: 2.0–2.1 (`>=2.0,<2.2`)
- **Alembic**: >=1.7

### Known Limitations

- `RETURNING` clauses not supported (CUBRID limitation)
- No `Sequence` support (CUBRID uses `AUTO_INCREMENT`)
- Native `BOOLEAN` not available (mapped to `SMALLINT`)
- Lateral joins and writable CTEs not supported
- `RELEASE SAVEPOINT` is a no-op

### Fixed
- `visit_join` signature: added missing `from_linter` parameter to match SQLAlchemy base class
- `sqlalchemy.sql.util.warn`: replaced with correct `sqlalchemy.util.warn` API

### Added
- Full type annotations across all 8 source modules (mypy errors: 280 → 0)
- Compatibility Matrix in README (Python, CUBRID, SQLAlchemy, Alembic versions)

### Changed
- Development Status classifier updated from "Beta" to "Production/Stable"
- pycubrid optional dependency updated from `>=0.6.0` to `>=1.0,<2.0`
- All documentation updated to explicitly state "SQLAlchemy 2.0–2.1" support
- Version bumped to 1.0.0

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added
- `docs/SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`: Comprehensive support matrix documenting SQLAlchemy versions,
  Python versions, CUBRID versions, driver compatibility, feature support, type mappings,
  and known limitations — defines the 1.0 support boundary
- Documents private SQLAlchemy API usages that require the `<2.2` version pin
- Clarified public documentation to state SQLAlchemy 2.0–2.1 support explicitly

### Changed
- **pycubrid dependency**: Pin optional `pycubrid` dependency to `>=0.6.0` — required for
  tuple-based `fetchall()` return type introduced in pycubrid v0.6.0 (#72)
- Version bumped to 0.8.0 (stabilization release on path to 1.0)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **`visit_utc_timestamp_func`**: Compile `func.utc_timestamp()` to `UTC_TIMESTAMP()` instead of `UTC_TIME()`, returning a full datetime value instead of time-only (#53).
- **`get_indexes()`**: Fix PK index filtering — read `is_primary_key` from column 0 of the single-column query result instead of unreachable column 6, so primary-key indexes are properly excluded (#54).
- **`has_table()`**: Recognize views as existing objects by accepting `class_type IN ('CLASS', 'VCLASS')` instead of only `'CLASS'` (#55).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **pycubrid dialect variant**: New `PyCubridDialect` class (`cubrid+pycubrid://` URL scheme)
  for using the [pycubrid](https://github.com/cubrid-lab/pycubrid) pure Python DB-API 2.0
  driver. Subclasses `CubridDialect` — inherits all SQL compilation, type mapping, and schema
  reflection. Overrides only driver-specific methods: `import_dbapi()`, `create_connect_args()`,
  `on_connect()`, `do_ping()`.
- **`PyCubridExecutionContext`**: Execution context that uses pycubrid's native `cursor.lastrowid`
  (returns `int | None` directly) with SQL `LAST_INSERT_ID()` fallback.
- **`cubrid.pycubrid` entry point**: Registered in `pyproject.toml` so SQLAlchemy auto-discovers
  the pycubrid dialect via `create_engine("cubrid+pycubrid://...")`.
- **`pycubrid` optional dependency**: `pip install "sqlalchemy-cubrid[pycubrid]"` installs pycubrid.
- **30 new offline tests**: `test/test_pycubrid_dialect.py` covering driver basics, connect args,
  on_connect, do_ping, execution context, entry point registration, isolation levels, and
  misc methods.
- **Documentation**: Updated `docs/CONNECTION.md` and `README.md` with pycubrid driver information.

### Changed
- Version bumped to 0.7.0.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **`MONETARY` type class**: New `TypeEngine` subclass for CUBRID's monetary data type.
  Stores monetary values with currency — internally represented as DOUBLE with currency code.
- **`OBJECT` type class**: New `TypeEngine` subclass for CUBRID's OID reference type.
  Represents a reference to another CUBRID class instance.
- **Alembic autogenerate support**: `CubridImpl` now implements `render_type()` and
  `compare_type()` for CUBRID collection types (SET, MULTISET, SEQUENCE).
  Collection type comparison uses semantic equality (unordered for SET/MULTISET,
  ordered for SEQUENCE). CUBRID type imports are auto-added to migration scripts.
- **`merge()` factory function docstring**: Comprehensive docstring documenting all
  chaining methods (`.using()`, `.on()`, `.when_matched_then_update()`,
  `.when_not_matched_then_insert()`) with usage examples.
- **GitHub issue templates**: Bug report and feature request forms (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`).
- **ORM Cookbook**: `docs/ORM_COOKBOOK.md` — practical ORM usage examples with CUBRID-specific
  patterns, collection types, DML extensions, and gotchas.
- **10 new offline tests**: MONETARY/OBJECT type tests (4), Alembic autogenerate tests (6).
  Total: 396 offline tests, 99.45% coverage.

### Changed
- `alembic_impl.py`: Expanded from 69 lines to 141 lines with full autogenerate support.
- `types.py`: Added MONETARY and OBJECT classes (319 → 349 lines).
- `__init__.py`: Exported MONETARY and OBJECT types.
- Version bumped to 0.6.0.

### Investigated (Blocked)
- **SQLAlchemy 2.1 compatibility**: SA 2.1 does not exist yet (latest: 2.0.48).
  All 396 tests pass with SA 2.0.48 — readiness confirmed.
- **Async DBAPI support**: CUBRID Python driver has no async support — blocked.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **`REPLACE INTO` statement**: New `Replace` DML construct and `replace()` factory function.
  `replace(table).values(...)` generates `REPLACE INTO table (...) VALUES (...)` syntax.
  Exported from `sqlalchemy_cubrid` top-level package.
- **ODKU with subquery values**: `on_duplicate_key_update()` now accepts subquery and
  expression values (e.g., `val=(select(func.max(t.c.val)))`).
  Note: CUBRID does not support the `VALUES()` function in ODKU — use literal/subquery values.
- **Recursive CTE support**: Verified `WITH RECURSIVE` works in CUBRID 11.x+.
  SQLAlchemy's base compiler generates correct syntax — 3 offline tests added.
- **Query trace utility**: New `trace_query(connection, statement)` function in `trace.py`.
  Uses CUBRID's `SET TRACE ON` / `SHOW TRACE` mechanism instead of standard `EXPLAIN`.
  Exported from `sqlalchemy_cubrid` top-level package.
- **Integration tests**: `REPLACE INTO`, recursive CTE, and `trace_query()` integration
  tests against live CUBRID Docker instance.
- **21 new offline tests**: `TestReplaceCompilation` (7), `TestRecursiveCTECompilation` (3),
  ODKU subquery tests (2), `test_trace.py` (7), ODKU expression test (1), ODKU literal test (1).

### Investigated (Not Supported)
- **Lateral joins**: CUBRID does not support `LATERAL` subqueries — syntax error in 11.2.
- **Full-text search**: CUBRID has no `MATCH … AGAINST` syntax or full-text index support.

### Changed
- `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md`: Added recursive CTE, lateral joins, full-text search, query trace,
  and REPLACE INTO rows. Updated Known Limitations & Roadmap section.
- `docs/DML_EXTENSIONS.md`: Added REPLACE INTO, ODKU subquery values, and Query Trace sections.
- Version bumped to 0.5.0.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Error code mapping**: `is_disconnect()` detects dropped connections via string-based message
  matching (14 patterns) and numeric CUBRID CCI error codes (-21003, -21005, -10005, -10007).
- **`_extract_error_code()`**: Extracts numeric error codes from CUBRID DBAPI exceptions
  (supports both integer args and string-embedded codes like "-21003 message").
- **`do_ping()`**: Connection liveness check using CUBRID Python driver's native `ping()`
  method — enables SQLAlchemy's `pool_pre_ping` feature.
- **Connection pool tuning guide**: `docs/CONNECTION.md` expanded with pool configuration
  recommendations (`pool_size`, `pool_recycle`, `pool_pre_ping`), CUBRID broker timeout
  interaction, disconnect detection, and error code mapping documentation.
- **CUBRID-Python driver compatibility matrix**: `docs/DRIVER_COMPAT.md` documenting tested
  driver versions, CUBRID server compatibility, and known issues.
- **Python 3.14 support**: Added to CI matrix and `pyproject.toml` classifiers.
- **44 new offline tests**: Comprehensive coverage for `is_disconnect()` (14 message patterns,
  4 error codes, edge cases), `_extract_error_code()` (7 tests), `do_ping()` (2 tests),
  `postfetch_lastrowid` validation (5 tests), and disconnect message integrity (3 tests).

### Changed
- CI integration test matrix expanded: Python {3.10, 3.12, 3.14} × CUBRID {11.4, 11.2, 11.0, 10.2}.
- `pyproject.toml`: Added `Programming Language :: Python :: 3.14` classifier.

- `docs/ALEMBIC.md`: Alembic migration guide — setup, configuration, limitations, batch workarounds.
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`: Development guide — setup, testing, Docker, coverage, CI/CD pipeline.

### Changed

- `docs/source/index.rst`: Added links to all new documentation files.
- `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md`: Updated version reference from v0.3.0 to v0.3.2.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-12

- Removed duplicate `pre-commit.yml` GitHub Actions workflow (functionality covered by `ci.yml`).
## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Alembic migration support via `CubridImpl` (`alembic.ddl` entry-point).
  Install with `pip install sqlalchemy-cubrid[alembic]`.
- `test/test_alembic.py`: 8 tests covering import, registry, entry-point, and import-error scenarios.

### Changed
- Edge-case tests added for compiler.py, dml.py, and dialect.py — coverage raised from 97% to 99% (306 → 314 tests).
- `docs/FEATURE_SUPPORT.md`: Alembic row updated from ❌ to ✅.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- `FOR UPDATE` clause support (`SELECT … FOR UPDATE [OF col1, col2]`).
- `INSERT … DEFAULT VALUES` and empty INSERT support.
- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`, `NTILE`, `LAG`, `LEAD`, etc.) with `OVER()` clause.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Minimum Python version raised from 3.6 to 3.10.
- **BREAKING**: Minimum SQLAlchemy version raised from 1.3 to 2.0.
- Complete rewrite of all dialect modules for SQLAlchemy 2.0 compatibility.
- Modernized project infrastructure (`pyproject.toml`, ruff linting, GitHub Actions CI).

### Fixed
- `compiler.py`: Fixed `visit_cast` missing space before `AS` keyword (`CAST(exprAS type)` → `CAST(expr AS type)`).
- `compiler.py`: Fixed `visit_CHAR` missing closing parenthesis.
- `compiler.py`: Fixed `visit_list` using Python 2 `basestring` — crashes on Python 3.
- `compiler.py`: Fixed `limit_clause` using `sql.literal()` without importing `sql` module.
- `compiler.py`: Fixed `limit_clause` for SA 2.0 (`_limit_clause` / `_offset_clause` are now ClauseElements).
- `types.py`: Fixed `REAL.__init__` calling `super(FLOAT, self)` instead of `super(REAL, self)`.
- `types.py`: Fixed `_StringType.__repr__` using `inspect.getargspec` removed in Python 3.11+.
- `dialect.py`: Fixed `get_pk_constraint` using string literal instead of f-string and missing `text()`.

- `dialect.py`: Fixed `get_foreign_keys` empty stub — now queries `db_constraint` system table.
- `dialect.py`: Fixed `postfetch_lastrowid = False` → `True` so SA can retrieve auto-generated keys.
- `dialect.py`: Fixed CUBRID driver defaulting to `autocommit=True` — `on_connect()` now calls `conn.set_autocommit(False)`.
- `dialect.py`: Removed unused `from cmd import IDENTCHARS` import.
- `base.py`: Implemented `CubridExecutionContext.get_lastrowid()` using `conn.get_last_insert_id()` with `SELECT LAST_INSERT_ID()` fallback.
- All files: Modernized `super(ClassName, self).__init__()` to `super().__init__()`.

### Added
- `dialect.py`: `import_dbapi()` classmethod (SA 2.0 API).
